You'll only have to do this once, and this is how we'll hire you on Upwork.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork. You can access it by logging in, and then clicking on your name. It'll look like [this](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca8ad8ce36b9eceb). If you don't already have an account, sign up for one [here](https://www.upwork.com/nx/signup/?dest=home).\n4. Copy the format below and paste it in a comment on this issue. Replace the placeholder text with your actual details.\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-16 at 4 42 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30609178/231263719-a8a3b7d3-36a0-4d7f-8ad4-cebe1f560fa4.png)\nFormat:\n```\nContributor details\nYour Expensify account email: <REPLACE EMAIL HERE>\nUpwork Profile Link: <REPLACE LINK HERE>\n```",

            "body": "> I cannot reproduce the bug. Is there something i have been missing?\r\n> \r\n>  Screen.Recording.2023-11-23.at.13.05.06.mov\r\n\r\n@felix-lambert  I believe you successfully reproduced the error, and it appears to occur quite promptly. From my understanding of the 'issue,' there is a noticeable lag after selecting the amount. The lag in the \"issue\" reproduction video seems high, on my machine, it was moderate, and on yours, it seems to be very fast.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an issue with the transition after selecting the amount. Currently, a black (or green) screen appears first, and then we proceed to select the participant. I was also able to reproduce this within a workspace, where after selecting the amount, participants are already selected, but the green screen remains in the middle of the transition.\r\n\r\nMy question for those with more experience is: why, in some scenarios, such as editing a field in a request for money, do the transitions occur like slides, smoothly sliding between pages? In other scenarios, the previous screen disappears, and a new one appears. In the case of this 'issue,' a green screen appears between the previous and next screens.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

This issue affects the fluidity and responsiveness of the user interface, particularly during operations that involve extensive contact lists.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\nThe root cause of this lag is the intensive computational demand of the `getOptions` function when processing a large dataset of contacts. Originally, this function took around 160ms to execute, which was significantly reduced to 15ms through optimization. \r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nTo address this issue, I propose the following changes:\r\n**Memoization of the `getOptions` Function**: By memoizing `getOptions`, we prevent redundant recalculations for repeated calls with identical arguments.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst memoizedGetOptions = _.memoize(getOptions);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n**Pagination/Infinite Scroll**: Instead of loading all contacts at once, implementing pagination or an infinite scroll feature would load a smaller subset of contacts initially, with more loading as needed. This approach would significantly reduce the initial data load and improve UI responsiveness.",
