In `AuthScreens`, when transitioning, this method will be called if app is logging as a new user (different user):\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a2fc32bbfb8d5917e83134568187529d488812e2/src/libs/Navigation/AppNavigator/AuthScreens.js#L160-L161\r\n\r\nThe problem is, upon transitioning to a new user, app is logging out:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a2fc32bbfb8d5917e83134568187529d488812e2/src/libs/Navigation/AppNavigator/AuthScreens.js#L164-L167\r\n\r\nthen redirected to `LogInWithShortLivedAuthTokenPage` to initiate `signInWithShortLivedAuthToken`:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a2fc32bbfb8d5917e83134568187529d488812e2/src/pages/LogInWithShortLivedAuthTokenPage.js#L60-L63\r\n\r\nIn this state, user has logged in with the email from the transition, i.e. email from the URL params is the same as the session email, thus the app is treating it as a login from the same email.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nThere needs to be a way of storing the previous session's email so that it can be compared accurately with the email from the new session.\r\n\r\n1. Add new property in the `Session` store:\r\n```javascript\r\n     /** The user's email of the previous session */\r\n    previousSessionEmail?: string;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create new utility to store the previous session email:\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction setPreviousSessionEmail(email: string) {\r\n    Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.SESSION, {previousSessionEmail: email});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. In `LogInWithShortLivedAuthTokenPage`, we store the email before logging in with the new one:\r\n```javascript\r\n       if (shortLivedAuthToken && !props.account.isLoading) {\r\n            Session.setPreviousSessionEmail(props.session.email)\r\n            Session.signInWithShortLivedAuthToken(email, shortLivedAuthToken);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n``` \r\n\r\n4. Compare the emails to mark the login session as a new login in `AuthScreen`:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst isTransitioningFromUser = SessionUtils.isLoggingInAsNewUser(currentUrl, session.previousSessionEmail);\r\nconst shouldGetAllData = isUsingMemoryOnlyKeys || SessionUtils.didUserLogInDuringSession() || isLoggingInAsNewUser || isTransitioningFromUser;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nN/A",
