This is what we currently do with the context menu as well, so it\u2019s obvious what message it\u2019s in reference to.\r\n\r\nPopover positioning is complicated to do well, and in some cases, such as screen size limitations, you simply can't use positioning to indicate what the popover references - that's why many popovers have arrow indicators, because for positioning, visibility and interactivity of the popover content is more important than positioning it desirably. And even if we could, it still would not be absolutely clear which message was being reacted to, the popover is too large for that.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that we don't highlight the relevant message when the emoji picker is open. This doesn't seem to be a regression, we just don't do it. We do it for the context menu, but not the emoji picker (note `isContextMenuActive`): https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/eef8347c59b5a3bb7fc508484f4c32ff092a05da/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionItem.js#L671\r\n\r\n<img width=\"360\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 4 19 36 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/2112202/52a58bc0-eda7-4bf3-8798-7b4735a0cc9e\">\r\n\r\n_Message highlighted when context menu is open_\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"360\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 4 19 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/2112202/b953d083-a0cd-4058-9a0d-5fceb2167704\">\r\n\r\n_Message not highlighted when emoji picker is open_\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nWe should highlight the relevant message when the emoji picker is open, just like we do when the context menu is active.",
