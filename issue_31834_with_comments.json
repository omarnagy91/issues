Just to help user not re-scan receipt in case upload failed for some reason.\r\nHere's scenario:\r\n- user scans receipt using device camera\r\n- upload to server and forget the receipt\r\n- after a while, failed to upload\r\n- user has no way to upload receipt again\r\n\r\nWith this local download feature, user can download scanned receipt to device and re-upload importing from gallery.\r\nSo first time user scans from camera, 2nd time imports from device gallery.\r\nMakes sense?",
