We can also use these properties for optimization.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/da549c0a45edb23fbe9616a9ce21915f291eabe4/src/components/SelectionList/BaseSelectionList.js#L453-L455\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, we can pass these values like props from `CountrySelectionPage`, `StateSelectorModal`, and other screens \r\n\r\n## What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nWe can also make separate configs for different numbers of elements\r\nAnd if the lists have more than 100 elements for example\r\nWe will increase the values (`initialNumToRender`, `windowSize`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`) to display elements better\r\nBecause the current values we use for long lists are not very suitable \r\n\r\nOr at least we can use dynamic values that we will calculate depending on the number of visible elements using `onLayout` from SectionList. But I'm not sure this approach will work for all lists. so if we decide to use dynamic `maxToRenderPerBatch`, then it is better to create a new prop that will enable and disable dynamic `maxToRenderPerBatch`\r\n\r\nWe can update `scrollToFocusedIndexOnFirstRender` like \r\n\r\n```\r\n   const [maxToRenderPerBatch, setMaxToRenderPerBatch] = useState(5);\r\n   \r\n    const scrollToFocusedIndexOnFirstRender = useCallback(\r\n        (layout) => {\r\n            if(isDynamicMaxToRenderPerBatch) {\r\n              // I added 5(or we can multiply by 2) because the scrolling speed is higher than updating elements as tall as a list. \r\n But this is more of an additional functionality\r\n             setMaxToRenderPerBatch((layout.nativeEvent.layout.height / layout.nativeEvent.layout.y) + 5); (optional Math.ceil())\r\n            }\r\n            if (!firstLayoutRef.current) {\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n            scrollToIndex(focusedIndex, false);\r\n            firstLayoutRef.current = false;\r\n        },\r\n        [focusedIndex, scrollToIndex],\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/components/SelectionList/BaseSelectionList.js#L313-L319\r\n\r\nAnd then update this line like:\r\n\r\n`maxToRenderPerBatch={maxToRenderPerBatch}`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/components/SelectionList/BaseSelectionList.js#L454\r\n\r\nAnd since we only need this functionality for a certain number of screens\r\nWe can use `isDynamicMaxToRenderPerBatch`\r\n\r\nWe can add this prop here \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/components/StatePicker/StateSelectorModal.js#L95-L104\r\n\r\nAnd here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/pages/settings/Profile/PersonalDetails/CountrySelectionPage.js#L91-L99\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We use Math.ceil instead of Math.floor because in cases wherein the quotients decimal is near the value `1` (0.9, 0.8, etc), a space may still show if we decide to floor it. \r\n\r\nThe value we get from the formula ```Math.ceil((window.innerHeight  - 129)/ 64)``` will give us the number of Country components that can fill the initial space.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?

            "body": "> @Fralalala I like your solution the most (calculating the `maxToRenderPerBatch` value based on the screen height is IMO a good idea), but the idea to change the `BaseSelectionList` the way you propose is not good - this component is used by the `SelectionList` component, which is used in many places in the app, so this calculation should not be done there. Please update your proposal to address only the issue with the country selector in the personal details page.\r\n\r\nTo solve this we can specify the num items inside the countryList and the State List  (Where we are seeing this issue) by calculating the number of items using onLayout and pass this as a prop to the SectionList .Then in the sectionList we can destructure this prop and give it an arbitrary value of 12  (the value already given to the list ) this way if no prop is passed it will behave as expected and the change will only apply to where we are seeing this issue. Something kind of like this\r\n`\r\nconst SectionList =({maxToRenderPerBatch=12})=>{\r\n`\r\nNow if we pass the value from the CountryLsit the change will only be applied there\r\n",
