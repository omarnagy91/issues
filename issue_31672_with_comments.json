Also add handles to update transaction tax details in Onyx and also pass tax details to API\r\n\r\nComponents and handlers should be created in a new way following this refactor PR https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/28618\r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\n\r\nIn phase 2, we'll add more logic to tax input fields.\r\n- Handling and displaying system messages when tax rates are updated\r\n- When updating category, we need to apply category expense rule and hence update tax rate field and tax amount field accordingly\r\n- As mentioned in design doc, only specific users can edit the tax details depending on the state of report\r\n\r\n## Why is this important?\r\n\r\nTo allow users to track tax on the expenses, and migration users to newdot.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nImplement the section of the design doc\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @MonilBhavsar</details>",
