When handling updates to searchTerm, we can parse the string with the same parsing logic from `WorkspaceInvitePage`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n",

I'll tag you if things don't work out and we want to consider your proposal\r\n\r\nStill unable to get it working. Do you mind sending a screen recording so I can see what you are doing? Thanks.\r\n\r\nI have the code ready, I am just unable to test it because I can't get the drawer to open. (And it hasn't got anything to do with my changes, because I can't even get it working on new.expensify.com)",
