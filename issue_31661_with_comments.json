Here we wait for the routes to be populated in navigation [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2009) and, later, perform navigation [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2019) using `PUSH`. As we are additionally pushing the route, there will be two route entries for RHP page as shown below. This is the root cause for the user to be navigated back to the same page. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-22 at 4 26 11 PM](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/3004659/7ac9cc90-826d-48cb-8545-12075243e165)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour can be observed for `Start chat` RHP page.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, desktop applications have problem for deep link URL due to the additional call to `navigate` function. I have also added a [proposal there](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/28495#issuecomment-1822977502)\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, we can simply remove the call to `navigate` function [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/6c29cabf1cce381bc927af52f819223ba6b541bc/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2019)\r\n\r\n`-                Navigation.navigate(route, CONST.NAVIGATION.ACTION_TYPE.PUSH);`\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nThe alternate approach used was to replace `PUSH` with `REPLACE` like this.\r\n\r\n Navigation.navigate(route, CONST.NAVIGATION.ACTION_TYPE.REPLACE);",
