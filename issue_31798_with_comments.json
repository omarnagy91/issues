All the available options had been summarised [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/28019#issuecomment-1733248145). However, the final conclusion was to ignore auto sign-in after initial incorrect submission and PR for the issue implemented manually submission if the magic code was submitted incorrectly for the first time. This is the reason why auto sign-in does not work here.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nTo allow auto sign-in post initial incorrect submission, we need to reset the `wasSubmitted` flag only if all the other inputs are set already and if this was the last key that was entered. We can do as follows [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f52c59d55be2d6d2775623d92c3043bd6d42cc0f/src/components/MagicCodeInput.js#L194) in `onChangeText`\r\n\r\n        const newIndex = editIndex + (numbersArr.length - 1) + 1;\r\n        if (_.filter(numbers, (n) => ValidationUtils.isNumeric(n)).length === props.maxLength && newIndex > props.maxLength - 1) {\r\n            setWasSubmitted(false);\r\n        }   \r\n\r\nIf we do not check that all the other inputs are set already, the user will notice that sometimes keying in any input within the magic code also triggers resubmission which is not a consistent behaviour for users.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, post initial incorrect submission, the focus on the magic code text input is lost for the user. So, the user is forced to select any one input and, then, proceed. Here, on `validateAndSubmit` we may want to bring the focus back on to the first input as follows [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f52c59d55be2d6d2775623d92c3043bd6d42cc0f/src/components/MagicCodeInput.js#L143) so that the user does not have to select any input before keying again with the correct magic code.\r\n\r\n        // Set the focus on the first input\r\n        inputRefs.current[0].focus(); \r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
