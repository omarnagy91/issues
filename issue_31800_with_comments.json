During this period of time, we can clear the input and as a result, we are still waiting for a response and showing a loader until we receive a response from the server\r\nThat's why the loader is still showing\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f52c59d55be2d6d2775623d92c3043bd6d42cc0f/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2501-L2502\r\n\r\n## What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nSince we will in any case disable the loader after the server responds and it makes no sense to forcefully change the value in ONYX, in my opinion, it is best not to show the loader when we have an empty input\r\n\r\nSo we can update this line like \r\n\r\n`isLoadingNewOptions={!!this.state.searchValue && this.props.isSearchingForReports}`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/7a68a3d1003130e63065bcbef253c912a3431c08/src/pages/SearchPage.js#L212\r\n\r\n## What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nAlso, we can add a new prop for `OptionsSelector` which will be called 'shouldDisableLoadingWhenEmptyValue'. Which will disable the loader when the list is empty at the `BaseOptionsList` level to pass this param in `SearchPage` or other places. Or we can make this behaviour by default \r\n\r\nPlus I don\u2019t like why when we hover over the loader we see a pointer cursor\r\nThis looks weird\r\nTherefore, I would suggest fixing this too\r\n",

When the user quickly emptied the input before the API call completes, the loader is not dismissed as expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nonChangeText(searchValue = '') { \r\n     if (searchValue.length) { \r\n         Report.searchInServer(searchValue); \r\n     } \r\n  \r\n     this.setState({searchValue}, this.debouncedUpdateOptions); \r\n } \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nThe quick workaround involves updating the `Report.searchInServer` function to check if the input value is empty before initiating the API call. If the input is empty, the loader display from the previous API call is immediately removed. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction searchInServer(searchInput) { \r\n    if (isNetworkOffline || searchInput.trim() === '') { \r\n        Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.IS_SEARCHING_FOR_REPORTS, false); \r\n        return; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Set the loading state right away\r\n    Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.IS_SEARCHING_FOR_REPORTS, true); \r\n    debouncedSearchInServer(searchInput); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe also need to eliminate the string length/empty checks from the calls to the Report.searchInServer method.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n onChangeText(searchValue = '') { \r\n     Report.searchInServer(searchValue); \r\n     this.setState({searchValue}, this.debouncedUpdateOptions); \r\n } \r\n```\r\nThis solution improves code readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nAn alternative solution is proposed to optimize the process further by maintaining a hashmap of already searched terms. This avoids unnecessary API calls when the user repeats a search term, enhancing performance.\r\n```\r\n...\r\nconst alreadySearchedTerms = new Set();\r\n\r\n\r\n....\r\nfunction searchInServer(searchInput) { \r\n    if (isNetworkOffline || alreadySearchedTerms.has(searchInput.trim())) { \r\n        Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.IS_SEARCHING_FOR_REPORTS, false); \r\n        return; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Set the loading state right away\r\n    Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.IS_SEARCHING_FOR_REPORTS, true); \r\n    debouncedSearchInServer(searchInput); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis alternative solution minimizes API calls by checking if the search term has been used before, providing a more efficient search mechanism. The hashmap is reset on page load to ensure the latest data is considered.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This approach introduces a caching mechanism. A potential drawback of caching is that it may not always provide the most up-to-date data during the search period. However, if immediate data updates are crucial, then additional API call should also be triggered when the search input is empty to fetch the latest information. \r\n",
