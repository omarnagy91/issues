    "body": "# Problem\n\nWhen user navigates back from Search Sidebar there\u2019s a noticeable delay and lag in closing the Search Sidebar. It mainly arises from withNavigationFocus HOC as it re-renders the BaseOptionSelector tree including OptionsList . Adding a memo to OptionsList doesn\u2019t help as it\u2019s parent gets re-rendered due to the withNavigationFocus HOC.\nAlso, we notice that due to isFocused state value in ActionItemView the ReportActionsList re-renders which also adds the overhead to the rendering cycle as it recreates the instances of recordTimeToMeasureItemLayout and loadOlderChats which are passed as props to ReportActionsList \n\n# Solution \n\nWe can remove the withNavigationFocus HOC and add navigation listeners(focus, blur) in BaseOptionSelector and memoize OptionsListto not re-render when state is set in it\u2019s parent. We can avoid recreating instances of recordTimeToMeasureItemLayout and loadOlderChats by wrapping them in useCallbacks and memorizing ReportActionsList.\n\nBefore on 6x CPU throttle:\n\nSee profile-ranked-before\nSee profile-timeline-before\nSee recording-before\n\nAfter on 6x CPU throttle:\n\nSee profile-ranked-after\nSee profile-timeline-after\nSee recording-after\n\nThe results looks impressive as we are able to save more than 700ms for the commit that happens when we close the Search sidebar.",
