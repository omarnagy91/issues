            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\nThe unread marker is not displayed. This only happens when the latest message comes from the current app user\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\nWhen we mark a message as unread from LHN, it will mark the last message as unread as in [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L916). In case the logged in user is the one sending the last message, that message will be marked as unread, which is not correct because the it doesn't make sense for the user to \"unread\" their own message. So based on [this condition](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/14abfa118d473baeba163f15e6042180892f71cf/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionsList.js#L342), the marker will not be visible on user's own message. \r\n\r\nIn this case we should do the same as Slack does, which is to mark the \"latest message that doesn't come from current user\" as unread.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nIn [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L916), if `reportActionCreated` is not available, we should find the `latest message that doesn't come from current user` to get the `actionCreationTime`, and use that as the basis for marking the `lastReadTime`.\r\n\r\nWe might need BE change as well to follow the same logic.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nIf we want to fix the same way for marking unread from report action context menu, we need to pass the `reportActionId` to `markCommentAsUnread` and find the \"latest report action doesn't come from current user\" from that `reportActionId` backwards. This is also the same as how Slack does it.\r\n\r\nOr we can disable `Mark as unread` in report action context menu for report actions that come from current user.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",
