However, I'm not quite sure whether its value should be the contact information or fall back to `Hidden`.\r\nAccording to the requirements in the issue #27393, it seems that we want to display `Hidden`?\r\n\r\n> Let's update any place that expects a display name to fall back on the primary login. And if there is neither a displayName or a primary login, to fall back on \"Hidden\".\r\n\r\ncc @puneetlath ",
