So `Hideen` is shown after `openReport` API is complete.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nWe should update the front-end by removing `displayName` for optimistic personal detail here. And we also need to update for other cases that we add optimistic personal detail.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L590 \r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
