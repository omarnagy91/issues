This would mean that there are available dates next month \u2013 at least the `props.maxDate` will be available. We should also modify the navigation to the previous month in a similar way.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst hasAvailableDatesNextMonth = startOfDay(new Date(this.props.maxDate)) > endOfMonth(new Date(this.state.currentDateView));\r\nconst hasAvailableDatesPrevMonth = endOfDay(new Date(this.props.minDate)) < startOfMonth(new Date(this.state.currentDateView));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, we'll need to prevent the non-existing days from being falsely marked as \"selected\" when navigating, so we should also add a `!!day` (or even `!isDisabled`) check here:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst isSelected = !!day && isSameDay(parseISO(this.props.value), new Date(currentYearView, currentMonthView, day));\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/d521dd6783c382297e06a429701ae1936f808041/src/components/NewDatePicker/CalendarPicker/index.js#L218-L222\r\n\r\n#### Result:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/12595293/50ca2707-a004-4ac5-9af2-a917f211d0db\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
