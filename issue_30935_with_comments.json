            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\n\r\nConsole error shows when sending a message\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/d5725c52bead4baa02ecec38915fc7c8c4316a4a/src/components/InvertedFlatList/index.js#L27\r\nWe should not use `React.createRef` in a function component because it recreates a new ref every time it is rendered\r\n\r\nThis is the root cause\r\n\r\nNote: **_Why does this bug appears recently_**? Even though `listRef` is changed on every render, the `listRef.current` has the instance of `FlatList` after render. The change of `listRef` triggers the [effect callback](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/da2c79e52860e6b367e92cda70c827e52c0edd34/src/components/InvertedFlatList/index.js#L35-L40) and so the innerRef.current has the instance of the FlatList. But introduction of [MVCPFlatList](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/FlatList/MVCPFlatList.js) in PR https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/28793 made things change. \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at this component, Below is the ref callback function\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/da2c79e52860e6b367e92cda70c827e52c0edd34/src/components/FlatList/MVCPFlatList.js#L147-L156\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we do nothing if `newRef === scrollRef.current`. `scrollRef` doesn't change once it's created. So [this code segment](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/da2c79e52860e6b367e92cda70c827e52c0edd34/src/components/FlatList/MVCPFlatList.js#L153-L155) runs only on mount. This means `forwardedRef.current` is set only once on mount. But as mentioned above, `forwardedRef` changes on every render and its `current` property has `null` value starting from the second render. That's why this potential issue appears recently.\r\n\r\nI don't think the logic of `onRef` of `MVCPFlatList` is wrong because ref itself(not current) doesn't change once it's created. We should fix the use of `React.createRef`\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nSimply updating the above code to\r\n```\r\n    const listRef = useRef();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould solve the issue\r\n\r\nOr we can remove the `listRef` from the component because it is not needed\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Result</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/126839717/46634214-aada-4a0d-8f22-a1fe09c05881\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
