If it's true, then we show it as an email, otherwise, we show it as a URL.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/881b511cc303e191f380ad74b6a84baf748a2b80/src/components/AnchorForCommentsOnly/BaseAnchorForCommentsOnly.js#L63\r\n\r\nIn the case of \"D@45.comGGgghbbbbbbv\", `Str.isValidEmailMarkdown` returns false. If we take a look at `Str.isValidEmailMarkdown`, it uses [EMAIL_BASE_REGEX regex](https://github.com/Expensify/expensify-common/blob/ee14b3255da33d2b6924c357f43393251b6dc6d2/lib/CONST.jsx#L3).\r\n\r\n```\r\n'(?=((?=[\\\\w\\'#%+-]+(?:\\\\.[\\\\w\\'#%+-]+)*@)[\\\\w\\\\.\\'#%+-]{1,64}@(?:(?=[a-z\\\\d]+(?:-+[a-z\\\\d]+)*\\\\.)(?:[a-z\\\\d-]{1,63}\\\\.)+[a-z]{2,63})(?= |_|\\\\b))(?<end>.*))\\\\S{3,254}(?=\\\\k<end>$)';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe regex only accepts lowercase a-z after the `@` part of an email. \"D@45.comGGgghbbbbbbv\" clearly has an uppercase of G after `@`, so the regex fails.\r\n\r\nHowever, our app successfully converted it to an email using ExpensiMark. That is because the email regex for chat message use the EMAIL_BASE_REGEX regex with a case insensitive flag.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/expensify-common/blob/ee14b3255da33d2b6924c357f43393251b6dc6d2/lib/ExpensiMark.js#L191-L194\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nWe have another util function from `Str` that checks whether it's a valid email with a case insensitive flag set called `isValidEmail`. So, we can replace `isValidEmailMarkdown` and `isValidEmail`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst isEmail = Str.isValidEmail(href.replace(/mailto:/i, ''));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`isValidEmail use the same EMAIL_BASE_REGEX but with case insensitive`\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nChange the ExpensiMark email parsing to discard the case insensitive flag, but I doubt we want to do this because GitHub itself allow uppercase letter for characters after `@`",
