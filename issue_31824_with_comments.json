It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I verified that this PR follows the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I verified other components that can be impacted by these changes have been tested, and I retested again (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` have been tested & I retested again)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] For Class Components, any internal methods passed to components event handlers are bound to `this` properly so there are no scoping issues (i.e. for `onClick={this.submit}` the method `this.submit` should be bound to `this` in the constructor)\r\n    - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR reviewer checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-25 at 12 28 25 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/dae1fd28-6ee1-42c1-8a66-0b0d36682d2e\">\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-25 at 12 28 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/78ad2048-244b-438e-aa15-a45d8fe73228\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 36 43 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/be616078-8d5b-4952-ac9e-6dbc38a42ca6\">\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 41 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/a0a9e57b-0e1c-4ded-92a0-d6fc14b3b894\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n<img width=\"416\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 54 01 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/9af3f890-b3a1-42c8-a026-1a151c7f8310\">\r\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 12 03 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/f3ac1fc8-c327-4531-8f2a-48f0d4ef7622\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n<img width=\"477\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 13 44 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/95d3e7cb-029c-4747-a803-36997a782663\">\r\n<img width=\"433\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 14 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/bd165fa5-c7e6-4ce4-9b18-a87d5ddb9028\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 48 11 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/ebb2176c-6cdf-4eff-9f08-b19ebf7f96bd\">\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 49 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/18c24259-cf74-4456-919b-4dea0768c887\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 54 51 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/3cc25488-e580-4522-9435-6f37bf4875d5\">\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 55 15 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/f002b881-2f7d-48e8-80b6-0c5bfd061bfd\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![android2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/54f6b8b8-febe-4d1e-9995-9d337a49c837)\r\n![android1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/9b75c7ac-c669-47d4-921e-b88bc5e71292)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![android_web1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/566bedba-8f02-46ae-9d96-904b502d96b0)\r\n![android_web2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/1ab778ff-4a62-4df5-9722-1a5af8b29d96)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![ios2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/d7fd22cd-f485-4e07-bdc6-3c003c5e2022)\r\n![ios1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/6625438c-c3c1-459f-9327-64a424e00b77)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![ios_web2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/a8042353-fcd0-433b-b059-50d3334b45b6)\r\n![ios_web1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/02e97351-79dc-4109-b3bf-9ca799626295)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n<img width=\"1296\" alt=\"web2\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/eca7a42d-9455-49b4-b9b5-678bdbadbddc\">\r\n<img width=\"1297\" alt=\"web1\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/c3666092-f4ad-47f9-bedc-c14ee797b23c\">\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![desktop2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/ce228c06-8985-4340-b128-e67b94d1351d)\r\n![desktop1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/27f19aeb-1147-4540-b731-e05d4971652c)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
