We can copy the parsed markdown to the plain text of the clipboard while still keeping the code that sets the html on the clipboard so that the already working paste html code implementation inside `Composer` will also be provided with the html, which means this specific bug mentioned on the issue will be solved on privates notes while keeping the working code(logic) of the `Composer` component intact \ud83d\udc4d .\r\ni.e we change \r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/7b546b0470b34bcaf5b9ee85e5011fff42443fc4/src/pages/home/report/ContextMenu/ContextMenuActions.js#L284-L292\r\nto \r\n```\r\n} else if (content) {\r\n                    const parser = new ExpensiMark();\r\n                    const markdown = parser.htmlToMarkdown(content);\r\n                    if (!Clipboard.canSetHtml()) {\r\n                        Clipboard.setString(markdown);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        \r\n                        Clipboard.setHtml(content, markdown);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```\r\nHere is the result:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/38649957/0390e601-bfec-4f87-87f7-6e47ad576cdc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?

I've get familiar with the issue a little and I think that the root cause here is that `TextInput` on the Private Notes screen doesn't support pasting HTML content (like it is in `Composer` example). \r\n\r\nAfter getting acquainted with both of the avaiable proposal, I can see flaws on both of them, which I want to point uout separetly:\r\n- @yh-0218: your proposal is getting rid of not only the issue, but the correctly implemented part of the code as well. We should still be able to copy/paste the HTML content, not only as string. The `Clipboard.canSetHtml` function, which you want to get rid of, is exacly for this purpose - enable the HTML copying\r\n- @FitseTLT - your solution would work, but it would require from us to create platform-dependant versions of the edit private notes screen as we are creating listeners on `document` object. In my opinion it's not worth it in this case to condemn contributors to maintain both very similar versions of code. But **I like more your alternative solution** to pass the markdown version of content as `text/plain`. If you could update your proposal so this one would be the primary solution I would be glad.\r\n\r\nI believe that the secondary solution from the @FitseTLT is the most promising. From mine point of view copying function should copy the contant ideally with formatting, so exposing both versions HTML and Markdown of the content is expected here",

So, is that a bug?` may be a bug but this is out of scope of this issue.\r\n> \r\n> Quick question about the proposal:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>                     if (!Clipboard.canSetHtml()) {\r\n>                         Clipboard.setString(markdown);\r\n>                     } else {\r\n>                         Clipboard.setHtml(content, markdown);\r\n>                     }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Can we not remove this if/else and do only `Clipboard.setString(markdown);`?\r\n\r\nIf we remove we will no more be providing html content to the clipboard which is needed in the `handlePasteHtml` implementation in `Compose` component (web), that's why we chose to provide markdown as plain text for other implementation (to also fix this issue) and provide the html for the `Compose` web implementation \ud83d\udc4d .
