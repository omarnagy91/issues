            "body": "> @FitseTLT unless i am missing something here, this particular issue aims to solve the issue for wallet screen popover not the context menu for chat it should be treated as a seperate issue (if it is a issue as far as i guess this is expected for context menu and this does not create any ui inconsistency) you can raise this on slack channel if you are sure this is a issue needs to fixed and there's no GH handling that already\r\n\r\nThanks @ishpaul777 you're right. Because I couldn't add a bank account (via Plaid) when I reproduced exact bug with PopoverReportActionContextMenu I thought we were using the same popover \ud83d\ude4f in the wallet page.\r\n@akinwale @kevinksullivan Can U help create a new issue to deal with the `PopoverReportActionContextMenu` repositioning issue commented in my [proposal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/31706#issuecomment-1823347399) and indicated below in the videos. It is even more important issue than this one b/c `PopoverReportActionContextMenu` is far more commonly used popover menu.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/38649957/87749c60-57b5-416b-8d86-1f34a41281a1\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/38649957/c1533975-6141-4b82-9691-c75a158660f6\r\n",
