So the root cause is a conflict with the chrome hardware acceleration and the emoji rendering. This could be because the`FlatList` and the `renderItem` is not optimised as much as possible, but tweaks didn't solve that, but rather adjusting the styling of the `Text` for `emojiText` does. \r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nRemoving the styling of the `emojiText` in the `EmojiPickerMenuItem` component (so its just the emoji unicode) fixes the flickering, so to fix the problem we just need to update the styling of the Text component for emojiText so that it doesn't conflict with the chrome browser on rendering as is currently happening.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of concept, if I remove all styling on `emojiText`, or even just the `fontSize` so that the Text component just renders as a unicode emoji, the flickering stops (see video). \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/c2e40423ac71fa67e65b570342c39e4c2b25a46f/src/styles/styles.ts#L1868C1-L1875C1\r\n\r\nNote in the solution the styling will match the current styling, this is a POC. \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HQPsc7n\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5fiUw8V \r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
