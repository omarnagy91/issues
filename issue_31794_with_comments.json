            "body": "Problem Statement:\r\nThe cursor in the TextInput component within the Composer loses its position when the user scrolls on Android devices.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Analysis:\r\nOne potential cause is that the ScrollView containing the TextInput might be affecting the focus state of the input, or gesture handlers could be resetting the cursor position inadvertently.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution :\r\nHere's an example of how I  might modify the ScrollView and gesture handling within the Composer component to address the issue:\r\n\r\njsx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimport React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { ScrollView, TextInput, View, Keyboard } from 'react-native';\r\n\r\n// ... other imports and setup ...\r\n\r\nfunction Composer(props) {\r\n    // ... existing state and refs ...\r\n\r\n    // Ref for the ScrollView\r\n    const scrollViewRef = useRef(null);\r\n\r\n    // Handler for when the TextInput is focused\r\n    const handleInputFocus = () => {\r\n        // Ensure the ScrollView doesn't scroll, which can disrupt the TextInput's focus\r\n        if (scrollViewRef.current) {\r\n            scrollViewRef.current.setNativeProps({ scrollEnabled: false });\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // Handler for when the TextInput loses focus\r\n    const handleInputBlur = () => {\r\n        // Re-enable scrolling when the TextInput is not focused\r\n        if (scrollViewRef.current) {\r\n            scrollViewRef.current.setNativeProps({ scrollEnabled: true });\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // ... other handlers and logic ...\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <ScrollView\r\n            ref={scrollViewRef}\r\n            keyboardShouldPersistTaps=\"handled\"\r\n            // ... other ScrollView props ...\r\n        >\r\n            <View>\r\n                {/* ... other components ... */}\r\n                <TextInput\r\n                    // ... existing TextInput props ...\r\n                    onFocus={handleInputFocus}\r\n                    onBlur={handleInputBlur}\r\n                />\r\n                {/* ... other components ... */}\r\n            </View>\r\n        </ScrollView>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... rest of the component, propTypes, defaultProps, etc. ...\r\n\r\nexport default Composer;\r\nIn this , the ScrollView has been given a ref so that its scrolling can be programmatically disabled when the TextInput is focused. This prevents the ScrollView from moving and potentially disrupting the cursor position. The keyboardShouldPersistTaps=\"handled\" prop ensures that taps on the ScrollView when the keyboard is open do not dismiss the keyboard, which could also move the cursor.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nWith these changes, the TextInput should maintain its cursor position when the user interacts with other parts of the screen or when the ScrollView is touched. This solution assumes that the cursor issue is related to the ScrollView and gesture handling; if the problem persists, further investigation would be needed to identify other potential causes.",

            "body": "Problem Statement:\r\nUsers have reported that the cursor within the TextInput component of the Composer does not stay fixed while scrolling on Android devices in the Expensify app.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nThe root cause may involve the ScrollView that contains the TextInput component. It could be altering the focus state of the input or causing the cursor to reset due to scroll events. Additionally, gesture handlers within the app might be inadvertently affecting the cursor position.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\nTo mitigate this issue, I suggest modifying the ScrollView and gesture handling within the Composer component. The ScrollView should have a ref assigned to it, allowing for programmatic control over its scrolling capability. When the TextInput is focused, scrolling should be disabled to prevent any movement that could disrupt the cursor position. Conversely, when the TextInput loses focus, scrolling should be re-enabled. The keyboardShouldPersistTaps prop should be set to \"handled\" to ensure that tapping outside the TextInput while the keyboard is open does not dismiss the keyboard and affect the cursor.\r\n\r\nAlternative Solutions:\r\nAs an optional step, other solutions that were explored include optimizing the state and prop management within the Composer component to prevent unnecessary re-renders, as well as updating the React Native framework to the latest stable version to take advantage of improvements to the TextInput component.\r\n\r\nBy implementing these changes, we aim to provide a stable and consistent cursor position within the TextInput component, improving the user experience on Android devices. Further testing will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the solution and to identify any additional improvements that may be required.",
