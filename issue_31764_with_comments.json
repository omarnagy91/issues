When adding new member to room, we set pendingAction: add, when removing member, set pendingAction: delete (like what we did with WS (policyMembers).)\r\n\r\nThen add pendingAction to [result](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/pages/RoomMembersPage.js#L221)\r\n\r\n**Solution 2:** To be simpler, we can just add new filed to `report_{id}` when adding/removing member to store pendingAction\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const participantAccountsOptimistic= _.object(inviteeAccountIDs, Array(inviteeAccountIDs.length).fill({pendingAction: CONST.RED_BRICK_ROAD_PENDING_ACTION.ADD}))\r\n\r\n    const participantAccountsSuccess= _.object(inviteeAccountIDs, Array(inviteeAccountIDs.length).fill({pendingAction: null}))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen add `participantsOptimistic: participantAccountsOptimistic` to [optimisticData](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2120)\r\n\r\n`participantsOptimistic: participantAccountsSuccess` to successData\r\n\r\nand generate errors to failureData\r\n\r\nDo the same with removing room member\r\n\r\nFinally, add `pendingAction: participantsOptimistic[accountID].pendingAction` to [result](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a5e4fb3f975e4e2a769ccef01b4b4fec4172bef6/src/pages/RoomMembersPage.js#L221)\r\n\r\n**We should cover the case members are not in personalDetails**\r\n\r\nIn inviteToRoom function\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const newPersonalDetailsOnyxData = PersonalDetailsUtils.getNewPersonalDetailsOnyxData(inviteeEmails, inviteeAccountIDs);\r\n\r\noptimisticData: [\r\n...\r\n...newPersonalDetailsOnyxData.optimisticData\r\n];\r\n\r\nsuccessData: [\r\n...\r\n...newPersonalDetailsOnyxData.successData\r\n];\r\n\r\nfailureData: [\r\n...\r\n...newPersonalDetailsOnyxData.failureData\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/113963320/5ab193d1-baa5-4b26-93b3-f4102421cceb\r\n\r\n\r\n",
