The implementation used for Expensify is similar to the one quoted. Therefore I suggest to stop omitting this parameter for iOS. We should pass the same `props` as for Android and web, without omitting the `selection` prop that is happening here:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/eee46dc3e9fffd2fb737dadbd70975f752787a42/src/components/Composer/index.ios.js#L112-L113 ",

You'll only have to do this once, and this is how we'll hire you on Upwork.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork. You can access it by logging in, and then clicking on your name. It'll look like [this](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca8ad8ce36b9eceb). If you don't already have an account, sign up for one [here](https://www.upwork.com/nx/signup/?dest=home).\n4. Copy the format below and paste it in a comment on this issue.
