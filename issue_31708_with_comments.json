Then, we have a `useEffect` that will update the `selection` state if `selection` prop is changed.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/704f3f7f4d39e0a155b6d29bdbb18a380d726e0a/src/components/Composer/index.js#L193-L200\r\n\r\nIn our case, the `selection` props is 0.\r\n\r\nThere is also another code that caused the unwanted autofocus.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/704f3f7f4d39e0a155b6d29bdbb18a380d726e0a/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ComposerWithSuggestions/ComposerWithSuggestions.js#L511-L513\r\n\r\nThe code above will (run on mount) set the selection to the end of the composer and scroll the composer to the bottom. This means we have 2 selection logic, 1 with the fix of https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/15105 (with a state), and 1 without the fix (with a native method).\r\n\r\nThat's why the composer is always autofocused and the selection is at the start of the text.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nFirst, we should move the mWeb Safari fix to `updateMultilineInputRange`. In `updateMultilineInputRange`, we already pass `shouldAutoFocus`, so we can use the same logic as in `ComposerWithSuggestion`, that is don't set the selection if it's an mWeb Safari and the autofocus is false.\r\n```js\r\nconst shouldSetSelection = !(Browser.isMobileSafari() && !shouldAutoFocus);\r\nif (shouldSetSelection) {\r\n    input.setSelectionRange(length, length);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, update the `selection` initial value in `ComposerWithSuggestion` to 0.\r\n```js\r\nconst [selection, setSelection] = useState(() => ({start: 0, end: 0}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, initialize the `selection` state in `Composer` based on the `selection` prop.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [selection, setSelection] = useState({\r\n    start: selectionProp.start,\r\n    end: selectionProp.end,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will make sure the input won't be autofocused when it shouldn't (the real issue) on mWeb Safari but the input is still scrolled to the bottom.",
