            "body": "# Proposal\r\n## Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\n\r\nStatus - Selected emojis in the status page's emoji picker don't add to frequently used section \r\n\r\n## What is the root cause of that problem?\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that in order to store the values in the frequently used section we must use a separate function(`User.updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis`)\r\nWhich is not used on the status screen, unlike other places\r\n\r\nUsage example: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/458e2709d9e61a31d9a25875a02c097ee8d7d80e/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ComposerWithSuggestions/ComposerWithSuggestions.js#L157-L160\r\n\r\n## What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nSince this functionality, in my opinion, should exist for all places where we use `EmojiPickerButtonDropdown`, we can add this functionality inside `EmojiPickerButtonDropdown`\r\n\r\nFor example, we can update this code like this (This is an example that works well. I think this can be optimized or made as an optional functionality that can be disabled and enabled using an additional parameter)\r\n\r\n```\r\n        EmojiPickerAction.showEmojiPicker(\r\n            props.onModalHide,\r\n            (emoji) => {\r\n                User.updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis(EmojiUtils.getFrequentlyUsedEmojis([EmojiUtils.findEmojiByCode(emoji)]));\r\n                props.onInputChange(emoji);\r\n            },\r\n            emojiPopoverAnchor.current,\r\n            {\r\n                horizontal: CONST.MODAL.ANCHOR_ORIGIN_HORIZONTAL.LEFT,\r\n                vertical: CONST.MODAL.ANCHOR_ORIGIN_VERTICAL.TOP,\r\n                shiftVertical: 4,\r\n            },\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/458e2709d9e61a31d9a25875a02c097ee8d7d80e/src/components/EmojiPicker/EmojiPickerButtonDropdown.js#L38\r\n\r\n## What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nWe can use `onChangeText` and implement this functionality within `StatusSetPage`. But first, we need to update this function and add the ability to use `onChangeText` for `EmojiPickerButtonDropdown`\r\n\r\nLike \r\n\r\n```\r\n        EmojiPickerAction.showEmojiPicker(\r\n            props.onModalHide,\r\n            (emoji) => {\r\n                props.onChangeText(emoji);\r\n                props.onInputChange(emoji);\r\n            },\r\n            emojiPopoverAnchor.current,\r\n            {\r\n                horizontal: CONST.MODAL.ANCHOR_ORIGIN_HORIZONTAL.LEFT,\r\n                vertical: CONST.MODAL.ANCHOR_ORIGIN_VERTICAL.TOP,\r\n                shiftVertical: 4,\r\n            },\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/458e2709d9e61a31d9a25875a02c097ee8d7d80e/src/components/EmojiPicker/EmojiPickerButtonDropdown.js#L38\r\n\r\nAnd then update here like\r\n\r\n```\r\n                            <InputWrapper\r\n                                InputComponent={EmojiPickerButtonDropdown}\r\n                                inputID={INPUT_IDS.EMOJI_CODE}\r\n                                aria-label={INPUT_IDS.EMOJI_CODE}\r\n                                defaultValue={defaultEmoji}\r\n                                onChangeText={(emoji) => {\r\n                                    User.updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis(EmojiUtils.getFrequentlyUsedEmojis([EmojiUtils.findEmojiByCode(emoji)]));\r\n                                }}\r\n                            />\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f52c59d55be2d6d2775623d92c3043bd6d42cc0f/src/pages/settings/Profile/CustomStatus/StatusSetPage.js#L67-L72C3\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe can use `useEffect` which will be called when updating emoji inside `EmojiPickerButtonDropdown` or `StatusSetPage`\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSince in this case, we use `EmojiPickerButtonDropdown` within `FormProvider`, we can add similar functionality within `onInputChange`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f6ea6f3348c0dfe37d6a6c77509d96d0bc821ca3/src/components/Form/FormProvider.js#L292-L315\r\n\r\nAnd add a new parameter that will analyze the presence of emoji in inputs and save them in `frequentlyUsed`\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs the most radical way, we can add this functionality when clicking on an emoji inside the `EmojiPicker`\r\n",

I suggest we should move logic `updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` into EmojiPicker to avoid duplicated code and handle all same logic in one\r\nIn here\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f52c59d55be2d6d2775623d92c3043bd6d42cc0f/src/components/EmojiPicker/EmojiPicker.js#L48\r\nWe should add a new prop called `shouldUpdateFrequentlyUsedEmojis`. When this prop is true we will call `User.updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` function \r\n\r\nBecause currently, we are handling `updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` case by case in these places: AddReactionBubble, MiniQuickEmojiReactions, EmojiPickerButtonDropdown (Status Page, don't handle updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis), EmojiPickerButton (Main composer and Edit Composer). With my approach, we need to remove logic `updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` in AddReactionBubble, MiniQuickEmojiReactions. In EmojiPickerButton, we will pass `shouldUpdateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` is false, because here, we have another logic to handle `updateFrequentlyUsedEmojis` to cover many other cases like pasting text that contains emoji, selecting emoji from the suggestion,...\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
