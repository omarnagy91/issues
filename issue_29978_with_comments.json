            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\nUser mention in the system message is not copied. This is because the logic that's called when we click the \"Copy\" button hasn't been updated to handle accountID based mentions. It only handles login-based mentions.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\nWe're not handling copying for accountID-based mention like `<muted-text>invited <mention-user accountID=XXX></mention-user></muted-text>`, so when we copy it, it cannot be parsed properly to text or markdown so it just shows whitespace for the mention part.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n1. In `htmlToText` [here](https://github.com/Expensify/expensify-common/blob/6517be47d31aef07b15c90fdf347a341f3b9b58d/lib/ExpensiMark.js#L653) add a `personalDetails` params and pass it in when we're using `htmlToText`, can have `{}` as the default value\r\n2. In [here](https://github.com/Expensify/expensify-common/blob/6517be47d31aef07b15c90fdf347a341f3b9b58d/lib/ExpensiMark.js#L384), add a rule for `mention-user` tag, we'll extract the accountID from this tag (if exists), find the corresponding login or display name similar to [this logic](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/fcee2073f096ad60dd9f30c536342de7d3893282/src/components/HTMLEngineProvider/HTMLRenderers/MentionUserRenderer.js#L43), and insert it as `@${loginOrDisplayName}` inside the `mention-user` tag. In order to do this, we'll have to add a `getReplacementFn(personalDetails)` method to return the replacement function for usage in the `htmlToText`, so that we can inject the  `personalDetails` data in the rules\r\n3. Do step 1-2 similarly for the `htmlToMarkdown`\r\n4. When the above copied message is pasted, and sent as a new message, we can optionally inject the accountID (by getting it via login, from personalDetails) back inside the `mention-user` [here](https://github.com/Expensify/expensify-common/blob/6517be47d31aef07b15c90fdf347a341f3b9b58d/lib/ExpensiMark.js#L123), so if the primary login/display name/visibility status of the mentioned user changes, it will follow the correct display logic for mention in [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/fcee2073f096ad60dd9f30c536342de7d3893282/src/components/HTMLEngineProvider/HTMLRenderers/MentionUserRenderer.js#L43)\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nNA\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

Or I guess we currently just pull whatever the html is in the message field of the reportAction?\r\n\r\nover just grabbing the accountID from the mention and looking up the text that we're supposed to display again to avoid doing duplicate work? That seems like the approach that's being suggested in @tienifr's [proposal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/29978#issuecomment-1773692177), which I'm currently fine with.\r\n\r\nI feel like we could refactor whatever logic we're using to display the mention into a utility function that we can reuse in this situation.
