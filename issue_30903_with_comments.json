It works great with an additional observation here.\r\n \r\nThe observation is that the latest main does not show the Expense Report in LHN by default. We need to click on the Report Preview to invoke it explicitly. I'm not sure if this is intentional or is caused by some regression. \r\nI have added Step 4 to Test 3 Steps for testing the Expense Report to accommodate this change.\r\n\r\nOver to you for review.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/3004659/49aea1c0-fca4-4627-b2db-dfce03cae052\r\n\r\n",

Building React-Native from the source throws an error. https://expensify.slack.com/archives/C01GTK53T8Q/p1695826372213339\r\n\r\nI saw the slack communication but I could not open the full build log from [here](https://expensify.slack.com/archives/C01GTK53T8Q/p1695826400384639?thread_ts=1695826372.213339&cid=C01GTK53T8Q). So, don\u2019t know what is the latest error there.\r\nAnyway, clearing metro cache didn\u2019t work for you as mentioned in slack? \r\nWhen I get a build problem, I usually run `npm run clean` and reboot the system. That solves my problem. ",

Further, archived reports are shown below the non-archived reports.\r\n\r\n**Test 1: For Task Report**\r\n1. Go Offline\r\n2. In any chat report, create a task using FAB -> Assign Task\r\nExpected Result: Verify that the LHN shows the created task towards the top of non-archived reports in LHN rather than at the bottom.\r\n\r\n**Test 2: For IOU Report**\r\n1. Go Offline\r\n2. Click Global FAB ->Request Money\r\n3.  Click on `Manual` tab, enter amount and click `Next`\r\n4.

Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] If we are not using the full Onyx data that we loaded, I've added the proper selector in order to ensure the component only re-renders when the data it is using changes\r\n        - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR author checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/3004659/8479688d-f66f-45c7-97c2-2d2cf1fad8f4\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/3004659/f0896bfe-86f7-4254-9c6c-25bd18a6b09e\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Mobile Web -
