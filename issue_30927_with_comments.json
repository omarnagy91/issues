Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] If we are not using the full Onyx data that we loaded, I've added the proper selector in order to ensure the component only re-renders when the data it is using changes\r\n        - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR author checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/6cc98142-fae0-46d2-b939-3d2fe477c80f\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/53d8ec4d-b2ff-4b56-891c-f3214b997279\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/d623d056-b364-44f0-95cf-7087525cc597\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/80c9e27e-ab86-42bf-8b97-0621ef09d2b9\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/cb7dbbab-b473-486b-8599-073def23404f\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/39086067/8ea8fb1a-32c4-498b-908f-9e2cc671ee95\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
