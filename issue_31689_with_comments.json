            "body": "## Proposal\r\n    \r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\n- There are two bugs encounter that related to this issue:\r\n1.  After selecting the year, the input filed at the top does not update.\r\n2. The page closes, the new selected year is not saved.ENTER key\r\n**Note**: There is no green check mark near the year. (It is not a bug)\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\n1. In here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/b30b55574bd3453c7c8d012aa39d62fe9de569f6/src/components/NewDatePicker/CalendarPicker/index.js#L82\r\nwe do not call ```this.props.onSelected``` to update to datetime like we did with [onDayPressed](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/b30b55574bd3453c7c8d012aa39d62fe9de569f6/src/components/NewDatePicker/CalendarPicker/index.js#L101), that lead to the bug \"After selecting the year, the input filed at the top does not update.\"\r\n\r\n2. In [YeahPickerModal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/NewDatePicker/CalendarPicker/YearPickerModal.js), pressing on ENTER when user is focusing on the input component will auto submit the form because of the below logic:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3583f39575684f35afa24afdb759840af956f146/src/components/FormSubmit/index.js#L22-L26\r\n- The form is submitted but because the datetime is not updated (bug 1) so leads to the bug 2 \"The page closes, the new selected year is not saved.ENTER key\"\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n1. We can just update https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3583f39575684f35afa24afdb759840af956f146/src/components/NewDatePicker/CalendarPicker/index.js#L82-L95\r\nto: \r\n````diff\r\nonYearSelected(year) {\r\n        this.setState(\r\n            (prev) => {\r\n                const newCurrentDateView = setYear(new Date(prev.currentDateView), year);\r\n                return {\r\n                    currentDateView: newCurrentDateView,\r\n                    isYearPickerVisible: false,\r\n                    years: _.map(prev.years, (item) => ({\r\n                        ...item,\r\n                        isSelected: item.value === newCurrentDateView.getFullYear(),\r\n                    })),\r\n                };\r\n            },\r\n+          () => this.props.onSelected(format(new Date(this.state.currentDateView), CONST.DATE.FNS_FORMAT_STRING)),\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n2. We just call the ```onSubmit``` if we are focusing on the [DateOfBirthPage](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/pages/settings/Profile/PersonalDetails/DateOfBirthPage.js). Do it by updating:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3583f39575684f35afa24afdb759840af956f146/src/pages/settings/Profile/PersonalDetails/DateOfBirthPage.js#L80\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nonSubmit={isFocusOnScreen ? PersonalDetails.updateDateOfBirth : () => {}}\r\n```\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n- **The RCA** of this bug is that, currently, in the [FormSubmit](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/FormSubmit/index.js) component, we did not use ```onKeyDownCapture``` to listen the keydown event rather than using ```useKeyboardShortcut``` as we did entire the app, that leads to the inconsistency, and we cannot manage the keydown event listener in [FormSubmit](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/FormSubmit/index.js) by using [bindHandlerToKeydownEvent](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/libs/KeyboardShortcut/bindHandlerToKeydownEvent/index.ts).\r\n- **Solution**: \r\n1. First, refactor the [FormSubmit](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/FormSubmit/index.js) to use the ```useKeyboardShortcut``` for consistency.\r\n\r\n2. Then, just need to set ```shouldBubble: false``` in  YearPickerModal `s keydown event listener.",

First, refactor the [FormSubmit](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/FormSubmit/index.js) to use the ```useKeyboardShortcut``` for consistency.\r\n\r\n3. Then, just need to set ```shouldBubble: false``` in  YearPickerModal `s keydown event listener.",
