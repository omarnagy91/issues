The same bug also happen when we click back button\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/0cca90ab9aa7fd9467ef45ca35c4d0ad3c3334ae/src/pages/ReferralDetailsPage.js#L63\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nWe should define new goBack function in the ReferralDetailsPage\r\nWe should use `referralContentType` in route to detect which is previous page and navigate to this page directly:\r\n- If contentType is startChat, goBack function will be navigating to StartChatPage\r\n- Similar to other page\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
