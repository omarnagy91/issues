And in `ReportActionsList` component comes a change in  container style associated with changing of  the `isLoadingNewerReportActions` prop in [this](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/db37e46f58aceea23c0136e1bdce6e3ed9d2d90f/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionsList.js#L399C1-L402C7) part of code. ( It adds or remove `paddingTop: CONST.CHAT_HEADER_LOADER_HEIGHT`  to the container so that the content moves up and the loader becomes visible ) . It Is the main cause of shaking of the content\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nI suggest removing this part of the code and setting the `paddingTop: CONST.CHAT_HEADER_LOADER_HEIGHT` always   \r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nAlternatively we can  fix  [_.throttle](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/db37e46f58aceea23c0136e1bdce6e3ed9d2d90f/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionsView.js#L201C1-L223C21) function in `ReportActionsView` component and increase throttle time.\r\n#### What is wrong and need to be fixed :\r\nNow the [code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/db37e46f58aceea23c0136e1bdce6e3ed9d2d90f/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionsView.js#L199) is written incorrectly and the `loadNewerChats` function is called without throttling. It  is wrapped in `useMemo` which has deeps which changes after every call of `Report.getNewerActions` and the `loadNewerChats` function re-defines again ( Which makes using the `_.throttle` this way pointless ). \r\n",

These adjustments correlate with changes in the `isLoadingNewerReportActions` prop, specifically the addition or removal of `paddingTop: CONST.CHAT_HEADER_LOADER_HEIGHT`.\r\n\r\nThe shaking occurs during scrolling, particularly when the scroll indicator approaches the bottom, triggering the `Report.getNewerActions` function.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nIn my perspective, this may not be a bug but rather a design decision. Three potential options for handling the loading circle's appearance are:\r\n\r\n1- Current Behavior: Allow the content to move up and down as it does currently.\r\n2 - Fixed Space for Loading Circle: Create a designated space for the loading circle, ensuring it appears and disappears without affecting existing content.\r\n3 - Scroll Height Increase: Maintain the content in its current position while extending the overall height of the message scroll. Place the loading circle at the bottom, visible when users scroll to the very end.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nAs an alternative, we could replace the loading circle with a Linear Progress Indicator, taking the place of the existing padding. This avoids height adjustments and provides a continuous indication of the loading process.\r\n\r\n",
