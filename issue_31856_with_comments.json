But the user is not signed-out). \r\n- Then, if any API is called, the error \"Your session has expired. Please sign in again.\" is returned from BE side. Now, user is navigated to sign-in screen\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n- We need to sign-out right after the API ValidateSecondaryLogin is called by creating the variable ```shouldSignOut``` in [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/pages/settings/Profile/Contacts/ContactMethodDetailsPage.js):\r\n```\r\nconst shouldSignOut = isDefaultContactMethod && !loginData.validatedDate && !isFailedAddContactMethod\r\n```\r\n- And then updating:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/d985a0ee2604686911f34c99f5298af059622244/src/pages/settings/Profile/Contacts/ContactMethodDetailsPage.js#L121-L130\r\nto:\r\n````diff\r\n    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n        const validatedDate = lodashGet(this.props.loginList, [this.getContactMethod(), 'validatedDate']);\r\n        const prevValidatedDate = lodashGet(prevProps.loginList, [this.getContactMethod(), 'validatedDate']);\r\n\r\n        // Navigate to methods page on successful magic code verification\r\n        // validatedDate property is responsible to decide the status of the magic code verification\r\n+        if(shouldSignOut){\r\n+            // Sign out logic here\r\n+            Session.signOutAndRedirectToSignIn();\r\n+            return\r\n+        }\r\n        if (!prevValidatedDate && validatedDate) {\r\n            Navigation.goBack(ROUTES.SETTINGS_CONTACT_METHODS.route);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n- Also, when API ValidateSecondaryLogin is called, beside the ```loginList``` data, BE should return new authToken, credentials to update to Onyx and then, we can update the app to make sure it works properly, for example, authenticatePusher. So, with this solution, the user do not need to signe out. \r\n- First, create a variable ```shouldUpdateSession``` in [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/pages/settings/Profile/Contacts/ContactMethodDetailsPage.js)\r\n```\r\nconst shouldUpdateSession = isDefaultContactMethod && !loginData.validatedDate && !isFailedAddContactMethod\r\n```\r\n- And then updating:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/d985a0ee2604686911f34c99f5298af059622244/src/pages/settings/Profile/Contacts/ContactMethodDetailsPage.js#L121-L130\r\nto:\r\n````diff\r\n    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n        const validatedDate = lodashGet(this.props.loginList, [this.getContactMethod(), 'validatedDate']);\r\n        const prevValidatedDate = lodashGet(prevProps.loginList, [this.getContactMethod(), 'validatedDate']);\r\n\r\n        // Navigate to methods page on successful magic code verification\r\n        // validatedDate property is responsible to decide the status of the magic code verification\r\n+        if(shouldUpdateSession){\r\n+            // Update session logic here\r\n+  PusherConnectionManager.init();\r\n+        Pusher.init({\r\n+            appKey: CONFIG.PUSHER.APP_KEY,\r\n+            cluster: CONFIG.PUSHER.CLUSTER,\r\n+            authEndpoint: `${CONFIG.EXPENSIFY.DEFAULT_API_ROOT}api?command=AuthenticatePusher`,\r\n+        }).then(() => {\r\n+            User.subscribeToUserEvents();\r\n+        });\r\n+            return\r\n+        }\r\n        if (!prevValidatedDate && validatedDate) {\r\n            Navigation.goBack(ROUTES.SETTINGS_CONTACT_METHODS.route); \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````",

It may involve the confirmCurrencyChangeAndHideModal function or the useEffect hook in WorkspaceInitialPage.js, which could be inadvertently affecting the user's session state when the currency is updated.\r\n\r\nWhat changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nWe should investigate the functions related to the currency update process to ensure they are not causing side effects that would sign a user out. This includes reviewing the Policy.updateGeneralSettings and ReimbursementAccount.navigateToBankAccountRoute functions called within confirmCurrencyChangeAndHideModal, as well as the useEffect hook that listens to changes in policy.outputCurrency. We need to ensure that these functions and hooks are not interfering with authentication and session management.\r\n\r\nWhat alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nAn alternative solution could be to add logging around the currency update process to capture more detailed information about the user's session state before and after the update to USD is attempted. This would help in identifying the exact point at which the sign-out occurs and could provide insights into whether the issue is with the currency update logic itself or with session management elsewhere in the application.",

You'll only have to do this once, and this is how we'll hire you on Upwork.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork. You can access it by logging in, and then clicking on your name. It'll look like [this](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca8ad8ce36b9eceb). If you don't already have an account, sign up for one [here](https://www.upwork.com/nx/signup/?dest=home).\n4. Copy the format below and paste it in a comment on this issue. Replace the placeholder text with your actual details.\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-16 at 4 42 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30609178/231263719-a8a3b7d3-36a0-4d7f-8ad4-cebe1f560fa4.png)\nFormat:\n```\nContributor details\nYour Expensify account email: <REPLACE EMAIL HERE>\nUpwork Profile Link: <REPLACE LINK HERE>\n```",
