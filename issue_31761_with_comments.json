            "body": "This is expected behavior. Shift+Space will scroll up. Since the sign-out button is at the bottom of the page, scrolling up will naturally bring the sign-out button out of view. The back handler API detects hardware button presses assigned to backward navigation in the search history. The error shown in the video isn't related to this issue. I have a proposal for changing this behavior if you'd still like to. The default behavior could be changed by adding custom logic to the shift+space scroll event. Essentially it'll have to be programmed to not scroll in the context when the focus is on the sign-out button. This could be implemented in JavaScript. One other solution if you don't want to go that route would be to modify the CSS of the sidebar so that it adjusts the size of all the buttons/text based on screen size in such a way that no scroll bar is ever needed. No JavaScript would be needed for this method. ",
