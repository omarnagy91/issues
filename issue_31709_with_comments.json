When emoji button is tapped, `relatedTargetId` is empty.\r\nPlease check the following code\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/34d165ef639eb77da7e8a9eacb73e5a1a9f956df/src/components/Pressable/GenericPressable/index.tsx#L10-L19\r\n\r\nWe removed the `nativeID` in [this PR](https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/24482) and used id instead intentionally, but we didn't remove the above code. so `id` props is redefined as undefined\r\n\r\nThis is the root cause\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nSimply removing the below code would solve the issue\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/34d165ef639eb77da7e8a9eacb73e5a1a9f956df/src/components/Pressable/GenericPressable/index.tsx#L18\r\n\r\n**Note**: We might need to remove all `nativeID` from the project\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Result</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/126839717/768ee690-a32a-4478-99d5-9d6e819cfac8\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
