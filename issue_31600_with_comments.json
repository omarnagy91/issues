That's why the error from link authentication shows up under magic code input as well.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nWhen we authenticate by link, we should not set the `account.errors` in Onyx because it's not needed and it impacts the original tab.\r\n\r\n1. Add a param `isLinkAutoAuth` to `signInWithValidateCode`, defaults to false\r\n2. In failure data [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/8c909d1a0b1c16d3130cc6d220f656f2ba9b2bdd/src/libs/actions/Session/index.ts#L496), if `isLinkAutoAuth` is true, we can set errors to null.\r\n3. Pass `isLinkAutoAuth` as true to `signInWithValidateCode`, at places where we attempt to sign in via link (and any other place where we don't want to persist the error in failure case)\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nIn `useEffect` of `ValidateLoginPage`, set `account.errors` to null if the `autoAuthState` changes to FAILED to clear the errors so it doesn't impact other tab.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit weird when the \"Magic code expired\" title shows regardless of whether the error is due to expired or incorrect magic code. If we want to fix it here, we can make it show according to the real back-end error.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",
