    "body": "## Problem\n \nApp is currently designed to load almost all of its code and resources in an eager manner, regardless of whether or not they are immediately needed. This results in unnecessary overhead and contributes to the slow boot time. \n\n## Solution\n\nImplement lazy initialization techniques for resources like regular expressions that are not immediately required.\n\nLazy loading for large JSON files, notably emoji data, optimizes imports across the application.\n\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/31776",
