It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I verified that this PR follows the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I verified other components that can be impacted by these changes have been tested, and I retested again (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` have been tested & I retested again)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] For Class Components, any internal methods passed to components event handlers are bound to `this` properly so there are no scoping issues (i.e. for `onClick={this.submit}` the method `this.submit` should be bound to `this` in the constructor)\r\n    - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR reviewer checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/97473779/59722b93-bf90-4e53-939a-0e071509165e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/97473779/0bca7ae5-20a7-4629-8c50-d145f07c99f1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
