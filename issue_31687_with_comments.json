When we open the currency selection page, the focus trap will \"save\" the last focused element, the currency symbol button. When we close the currency symbol button, the focus trap will re-focus on the currency symbol button. This is the default behavior of the focus trap which is explained [here](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap#what-it-does).\r\n\r\nBecause we select the currency with the keyboard, the blue outline shows, and then immediately the focus is moved to the amount input by this code.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/f6ef8b85f94d3f6d7c6c9f90d0c23897f66ce318/src/pages/iou/steps/NewRequestAmountPage.js#L74-L84\r\n\r\nIn a normal case, I think the behavior is fine, but the unpleasant thing here is that the blue outline is shown for a brief moment and then disappears.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nFor the money request page, don't refocus back to the last focused element by passing `shouldReturnFocusOnDeactivate` to the ScreenWrapper > FocusTrapView.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfocusTrapOptions={{\r\n    returnFocusOnDeactivate: shouldReturnFocusOnDeactivate,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn MoneyRequestSelectorPage and EditRequestAmountPage,\r\n```\r\n<ScreenWrapper\r\n    shouldReturnFocusOnDeactivate={false}\r\n```",
