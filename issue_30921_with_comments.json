It is currently set up to check for the draft of a new comment, but not for the draft of an existing comment, which uses a different Onyx key.\r\n\r\nThis component was connected to Onyx to improve chat input performance:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/25758/files#diff-6322282b36a11b64417bc4327aa7245c139a36643ce59f4cf32583d20164023e\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n`ExceededCommentLength` being tied to the Onyx store isn't ideal, but to retain the chat input performance gains that this achieves, we can allow consumers of the component to provide the draft key for Onyx:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ReportActionCompose.js (new draft)\r\n<ExceededCommentLength\r\n    reportID={reportID}\r\n    draftKey={ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT}\r\n    onExceededMaxCommentLength={setExceededMaxCommentLength}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n// ReportActionItemMessageEdit.js (edit draft)\r\n<ExceededCommentLength\r\n    reportID={reportID}\r\n    draftKey={ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS_DRAFTS}\r\n    onExceededMaxCommentLength={setExceededMaxCommentLength}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows the component to be used with any comment, and allows the consumer to specify where to retrieve it. This requires limited changes to the `ExceededCommentLength` component and no changes to functionality.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```js\r\nexport default withOnyx({\r\n    comment: {\r\n        key: ({reportID}) => `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT}${reportID}`,\r\n        initialValue: '',\r\n    },\r\n})(ExceededCommentLength);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```js\r\nexport default withOnyx({\r\n    comment: {\r\n        key: ({draftKey, reportID}) => `${draftKey}${reportID}`,\r\n        initialValue: '',\r\n    },\r\n})(ExceededCommentLength);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach allows `ExceededCommentLength` to continue using onyx to retrieve the comment for performance purposes, rather than just passing the comment in as a prop, which would effectively undermine #25758. \r\n\r\nTested locally.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1427\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-06 at 1 24 54 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/2112202/13685c00-da80-4ef2-9c7c-11c92e61c6b1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nMaking `ExceededCommentLength` a dumb component that just receives the comment through props and spits out a message. This is undesirable because it reverts some of the effect of #25758.\r\n\r\n",

Previously, ExceededCommentLength only accepts a `comment` props, but after a performance improvement PR (https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/25758), we started to accept `reportID` for the main composer so we don't need to subscribe to the main composer draft onyx on `ReportActionCompose` component.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n1. Remove the onyx subscription from `ExceededCommentLength`\r\n2. To get the comment from the onyx, create a new component called `MainExceededCommentLength` that will be used for the main composer only. This component will be the wrapper for the onyx connection.\r\n```\r\nconst MainExceededCommentLength = (props) => {\r\n    return <ExceededCommentLength comment={props.comment} onExceededMaxCommentLength={props.onExceededMaxCommentLength}/>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withOnyx({\r\n    comment: {\r\n        key: ({reportID}) => `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT}${reportID}`,\r\n        initialValue: '',\r\n    },\r\n})(MainExceededCommentLength);\r\n```",

Use reportActionID instead of comment [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/7601f89c6a1623cc1b68785720db8d1172b66315/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionItemMessageEdit.js#L465) \r\n\r\n `reportActionID={props.action.reportActionID}`\r\n\r\n2. Change the key [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/7601f89c6a1623cc1b68785720db8d1172b66315/src/components/ExceededCommentLength.js#L65) based on reportActionID and reportID\r\n \r\n```\r\n        key: ({reportID, reportActionID}) => reportActionID && reportID? `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS_DRAFTS}${reportID}`:`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT}${reportID}`,\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Get the comment from props\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const comment = props.reportActionID && props.reportID? get(props,['comment', props.reportActionID],''): get(props, 'comment','')\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Change [props.comment](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/7601f89c6a1623cc1b68785720db8d1172b66315/src/components/ExceededCommentLength.js#L41-L43) to `comment` (the one we get above)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?

Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n4. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n6. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

This ```comment``` is from ```ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT```\r\n- And [ExceededCommentLength](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/components/ExceededCommentLength.js) uses in [ReportActionItemMessageEdit](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionItemMessageEdit.js) as well, so when the main composer has < 10K characters, edit composer has > 10K characters, the edit composer will have no error. \r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n- Rather than getting the ```comment``` from ```ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT```, we can just pass the ```comment``` param to ```ExceededCommentLength``` from its parent component. This can fix this issue, also reducing the delay time in updating max length error (currently, when user types more than 10K, it will delay 1500ms before displaying error).\r\n- We can do it by these below steps:\r\n1. Remove subscribing ```ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_DRAFT_COMMENT```\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/2c7062b917a2d31b709691166633f171dd1fce8c/src/components/ExceededCommentLength.js#L63-L68\r\n2. With ```ReportActionItemMessageEdit```, we do not need to do anything because we already had the below logic:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/2c7062b917a2d31b709691166633f171dd1fce8c/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionItemMessageEdit.js#L468\r\n3. With ```ReportActionComposer```, updating\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/358c3bf4fd161c51cf4ea00110576af3afe03ce9/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ReportActionCompose.js#L454\r\nto\r\n```\r\n<ExceededCommentLength comment={value} ... />                 \r\n```\r\nwith ```value``` from:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/347df0cc6bc9c1af6a0c7d6ed4034e4222fbf37e/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ComposerWithSuggestions.js#L112\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n- To reduce the number of re-render times of component ```ExceededCommentLength```:  Rather than passing the ```comment``` param to ```ExceededCommentLength``` from its parent component like the above solution, we can just pass the param called ```isExceedMaxLength``` to ```ExceededCommentLength``` from its parent component. So the ```ExceededCommentLength``` just re-renders when the ```isExceedMaxLength``` update its value from true to false and Vice versa\r\n",

If we do not get the comment from Onyx, the ```ExceededCommentLength``` will re-render once the input change, affect to the performace.\r\n\r\n- But now, we just need to know whether the input is greater than the MAX_COMMENT_LENGTH or not, so my proposal suggested that, we just need to pass the ```isExceedMaxLength``` to ```ExceededCommentLength``` from its parent. So the ```ExceededCommentLength``` just re-render once the ```isExceedMaxLength``` update from \"true\" to \"false\" or vice versa. \r\n\r\n-  Besides fixing this bug, it also reduce the delay time when updating the error (Currently, updating error has 1500ms delay) ",

I think the number of re-render times in my solution is less than the @erquhart `s solution because with my solution, it just re-render if the ```isExceedMaxLength``` changes. Meanwhile, the another one will render once the input changes. Please correct me once you have a chance. \r\n- Also please note that, the solution that I mentioned is my **What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)** section in my [proposal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/30921#issuecomment-1809962677)\r\n  \r\n> Now, we just need to know whether the input is greater than the MAX_COMMENT_LENGTH or not, so my proposal suggested that, we just need to pass the isExceedMaxLength to ExceededCommentLength from its parent. So the ExceededCommentLength just re-render once the isExceedMaxLength update from \"true\" to \"false\" or vice versa.",

            "body": "All right, coming in with fresh eyes, I see we have multiple proposals here. Every time I've come across a similar problem (one component needing a piece of data that could exist in two different collections like a draft collection and a regular collection), the best solution I've always found is to lift up the onyx connection to the parents. I think this is the most simple, cleanest, most straightforward solution.\r\n\r\nThe only argument I hear against that is that it would undo a change that was made for performance. That's good to know, but it doesn't need to be a blocker for the solution. As long as the solution does not degrade performance, then that's really all that matters.\r\n\r\nI think the RCA from @DylanDylann was the most comprehensive and easiest for me to understand and I think both the main solution (only pass down `comment`) or the alternate solution (have a prop for `isExceedMaxLength`) is acceptable as long as you are able to prove that there is no performance decrease. I am leaning more toward `isExceedMaxLength` or maybe call it something like `shouldDisplayError`. Also, I'd love to get rid of the debounce. As I understand, the performance problem isn't in checking the length of the comment, but rather in the re-rendering of the component.\r\n\r\n@DylanDylann can you please show evidence that your solution won't lead to a performance regression, and then I think the job is yours.\r\n",
