Before making this external we need to agree on what the plan is. \r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n\r\n@roryabraham:\r\n> Maybe this isn't the best way to do it, but the way I'd approach this is to look at all the usages we have of MenuItem today to determine the permutations we already have in place, and go from there. \r\n\r\n@lindboe suggested speaking with the @Expensify/design team first: \r\n> If there's not clear boundaries between what's a separate permutation and what's not, it can be helpful to agree on structured design language so everybody's on the same page about what a \"component that looks like this\" should be able to do (as a contrived example, \"A MenuItem with Badge Text should never also show an RBR indicator\")\r\nIf there's any forward-looking thinking about MenuItem types (i.e., \"We always intended to...\") that can also be useful to know\r\n\r\n> My personal thoughts: from just the stories, I'm not seeing too many unique cases of content, but instead things that do act like flags (i.e., RBR indicator, focused, disabled states). But I know the stories might not be exhaustive so we'll have to go looking. Even so, even if we don't find clear permutations of content to break out, I think we can still decompose MenuItem into smaller parts.\r\n\r\n- [Internal slack discussion](https://expensify.slack.com/archives/C05EQBQG6E5/p1699041701481029?thread_ts=1699017414.494079&cid=C05EQBQG6E5)\r\n\r\ncc @roryabraham @lindboe @cdanwards\r\n\r\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\r\n\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0175d7d07fed937e12</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1721495493814456320</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2023-11-06</li>\n    </ul>\n</details>",
