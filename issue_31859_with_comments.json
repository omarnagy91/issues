Insert a new optional property called `comment` in `PayerOwesAmountParams`:\r\n```\r\ntype PayerOwesAmountParams = {payer: string; amount: number; comment?: string};\r\n```\r\n2. Update the translation `iou.payerOwesAmount` to \r\n```\r\n({payer, amount, comment}: PayerOwesAmountParams) => `${payer} owes ${amount}${comment ? ` for ${comment}` : ''}`\r\n```\r\n3. Export a new function for getting description from report action:\r\n```\r\nfunction getCommentOfMoneyRequest(reportAction: OnyxEntry<ReportAction>): string | void {\r\n    return reportAction?.actionName === CONST.REPORT.ACTIONS.TYPE.IOU ? reportAction?.originalMessage?.comment : undefined\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Use `getCommentOfMoneyRequest` in `getReportPreviewMessage` of [ReportUtils.js](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a7ce3753f36127ce6b32ea484069bdc599575fff/src/libs/ReportUtils.js#L1844) to get description, and put it in parameters of `iou.payerOwesAmount`:\r\n```\r\nconst comment = getCommentOfMoneyRequest(reportAction);\r\nreturn Localize.translateLocal(containsNonReimbursable ? 'iou.payerSpentAmount' : 'iou.payerOwesAmount', {payer: payerName, amount: formattedAmount, comment});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\n**Reminder:** Please use plain English, be brief and avoid jargon. Feel free to use images, charts or pseudo-code if necessary. Do not post large multi-line diffs or write walls of text. Do not create PRs unless you have been hired for this job.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n6. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n7. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",
