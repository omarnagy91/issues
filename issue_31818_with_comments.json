            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\n\r\nThe receipt image fails to display due to not detecting receipt image and rendering receipt image on update.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\n\r\nThere are two issues:\r\n\r\n1. The data received from the update API through Pusher does not return *receipt.state* and so the check fails at [TransactionUtils.hasReceipt]](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3363c35ea1be897cc13393c6c7f27d513ba605fb/src/libs/TransactionUtils.ts#L85)\r\n```\r\nreturn !!transaction?.receipt?.state || hasEReceipt(transaction);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Response received:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"data\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"key\": \"transactions_3824595210035866360\",\r\n            \"onyxMethod\": \"merge\",\r\n            \"value\": {\r\n                \"receipt\": {\r\n                    \"receiptID\": 675734846,\r\n                    \"source\": \"https://www.expensify.com/receipts/w_11f24f07f240fa5aa7ca57ec9f7a630533de3ba4.jpg\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"eventType\": \"onyxApiUpdate\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The transaction object is missing attribute filename so when [ReceiptUtils.getThumbnailAndImageURIs](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/1e4c84b8c17a8e08321dfbe91ea7e6e4bbddd54f/src/libs/ReceiptUtils.ts#L31) is called from MoneyRequestPreview so even if 1) was fixed the image won't be shown.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const receiptImages = hasReceipt ? [ReceiptUtils.getThumbnailAndImageURIs(props.transaction)] : [];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\n1.  Update transactions [TransactionUtils.hasReceipt]](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3363c35ea1be897cc13393c6c7f27d513ba605fb/src/libs/TransactionUtils.ts#L85) to check for  receipt.source or receipt.reportID\r\n```\r\nreturn !!transaction?.receipt?.source || hasEReceipt(transaction)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Update MoneyRequestPreview L177 to parse and pass in addition the *receiptPath* and *receiptFileName* from props.transaction.receipt.source when invoking ReceiptUtils.getThumbnailAndImageURIs\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst receiptImages = hasReceipt ? [ReceiptUtils.getThumbnailAndImageURIs(props.transaction)] : [];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\n\r\nModify change 2) in the solution:\r\n\r\nUpdate ReceiptUtils.getThumbnailAndImageURIs (instead of passing in receiptPath and receiptFileName) to also check filename for transaction.receipt.source\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const filename = transaction?.filename ?? (transaction?.receipt?.source?.split('/').pop())  ?? receiptFileName ?? '';\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Note: I also noticed that on initial creation that transaction.receipt is returned as an array from the API where it should be an object.  \r\n\r\n",
