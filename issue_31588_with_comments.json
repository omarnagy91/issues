In this solution, there is a condition to avoid the focus on native platforms, but the mWeb view is not present in this condition.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/d15f6dc882b26f508898d3f09a356cab4578edf6/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ComposerWithSuggestions/ComposerWithSuggestions.js#L491-L496\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nWe should replace the condition to use `shouldFocusInputOnScreenFocus` in place of the  `willBlurTextInputOnTapOutside`:\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    if (modal.isVisible && !prevIsModalVisible) {\r\n        // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign\r\n        isNextModalWillOpenRef.current = false;\r\n    }\r\n    // We want to focus or refocus the input when a modal has been closed or the underlying screen is refocused.\r\n    // We avoid doing this on native platforms since the software keyboard popping\r\n    // open creates a jarring and broken UX.\r\n    if (!(shouldFocusInputOnScreenFocus && !isNextModalWillOpenRef.current && !modal.isVisible && isFocused && (prevIsModalVisible || !prevIsFocused))) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (editFocused) {\r\n        InputFocus.inputFocusChange(false);\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    focus();\r\n}, [focus, prevIsFocused, editFocused, prevIsModalVisible, isFocused, modal.isVisible, isNextModalWillOpenRef]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
