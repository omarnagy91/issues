Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork.

Open a chat with long chats\r\n2. Scroll backwards quickly\r\n\r\n## Expected Result:\r\nMessages should load without stuck\r\n\r\n## Actual Result:\r\nIf I scroll backwards very quickly, it will get \"stuck\" -- and I need to scroll forward and then backwards again to get it to load the new page.  I think it might be that it loads one previous page at a time, and if I scroll quickly enough to get to the top of that page's \"skeleton\" before it displays, then it doesn't register me being at the top of it.  I need to scroll down to the \"next\" page, and then scroll back to the \"previous\" before it gets the one before.  I would expect it should never get stuck while scrolling backwards.\r\n\r\n## Workaround:\r\nunknown\r\n## Platforms:\r\n<!---\r\nCheck off any platforms that are affected by this issue\r\n--->\r\nWhich of our officially supported platforms is this issue occurring on?\r\n- [ ] Android: Native\r\n- [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n- [ ] iOS: Native\r\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n- [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n- [ ] MacOS: Desktop\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\nAdd any screenshot/video evidence\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/38435837/6af7c5be-6d5d-4839-b814-5392cf771062\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\r\n\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01dc47a9e2814684af</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1721284239551279104</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2023-11-05</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>jjcoffee | Reviewer | 27539278</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>",
