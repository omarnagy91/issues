            "body": "I'm available to raise a PR immediately if assigned\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\nAfter refreshing the page, the page appears for the second time.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\nThis comes from this PR https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/28453\r\n\r\nThe PR will (correctly) make navigate with PUSH type have PUSH type when dispatching the navigation action, see [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/21cf959fe3ace3229f0c68a80f9d8bc3dc76c2c2/src/libs/Navigation/linkTo.js#L90), so the navigation [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e5720a08e217fe76eec0b32e69da7efd348e84e0/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2019) thus pushing the screen to the state one more time, because initially the navigation state is already initialized with the initial route. So when going back it will go back to the same screen.\r\n\r\nWe didn't recognize this issue earlier because we used to convert 'PUSH' to 'NAVIGATE' before dispatching the navigation action.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nBefore navigation in [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e5720a08e217fe76eec0b32e69da7efd348e84e0/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2019), check if the current route is the route we're trying to navigate to (by using `Navigation.isActiveRoute`), if yes skip the navigation.\r\n```\r\nif (!Navigation.isActiveRoute(route)) {\r\n    Navigation.navigate(route, CONST.NAVIGATION.ACTION_TYPE.PUSH);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat navigation is needed in case of user logged out in native device and deep link, after logged in they should be redirected to the deep link. In that case the `Navigation.isActiveRoute(route)` will be false and it will still navigate.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nStraight revert is also an option but the fix for this is quick so I don't think we need to straight revert.\r\n\r\nAn alternate solution is in `navigate`, if the `type` is `PUSH`, we'll check `isActiveRoute` before navigating, this will make sure all places that are using `navigate` with `PUSH` will work fine. \r\n\r\nOr we can remove `CONST.NAVIGATION.ACTION_TYPE.PUSH` in the navigate [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e5720a08e217fe76eec0b32e69da7efd348e84e0/src/libs/actions/Report.js#L2019), but I believed it was added for a reason, so not recommended as much as the main solution.\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",
