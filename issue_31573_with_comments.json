This will ensure that the text selection state is preserved even if the mouse cursor moves outside of the input field.\r\n\r\nPlease add following code to onFocus and onBlur function in [/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ReportActionCompose.js](url)\r\n\r\nonFocus function: \r\n`document.body.style.userSelect = 'all';`\r\n\r\nonBlur function:\r\n`document.body.style.userSelect = 'none';`\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
