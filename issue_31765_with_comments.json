You'll only have to do this once, and this is how we'll hire you on Upwork.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork. You can access it by logging in, and then clicking on your name. It'll look like [this](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca8ad8ce36b9eceb). If you don't already have an account, sign up for one [here](https://www.upwork.com/nx/signup/?dest=home).\n4. Copy the format below and paste it in a comment on this issue. Replace the placeholder text with your actual details.\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-16 at 4 42 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30609178/231263719-a8a3b7d3-36a0-4d7f-8ad4-cebe1f560fa4.png)\nFormat:\n```\nContributor details\nYour Expensify account email: <REPLACE EMAIL HERE>\nUpwork Profile Link: <REPLACE LINK HERE>\n```",

            "body": "Proposal for Issue #31765: iOS - Notification - New Messages Not Displayed Until Online After Selecting Notification\r\nPlease re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\nIn the iOS version of the app, when a user receives a push notification for a new message, selecting the notification does not display the new message until the user reconnects to the internet. This happens when the app was previously closed and the device is offline at the time of selecting the notification.\r\n\r\nWhat is the root cause of that problem?\r\nThe issue likely stems from the app's handling of push notifications and local data synchronization when offline. The push notification handler (index.native.js) might not be updating the relevant Onyx keys (like ONYXKEYS.NETWORK) to reflect the arrival of new messages when offline. Additionally, there might be gaps in how the app manages AppState transitions and utilizes cached data in Expensify.js.\r\n\r\nWhat changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nTo address this issue, several modifications are proposed:\r\n\r\nUpdate Push Notification Logic: Enhance the push notification handling in index.native.js to ensure that relevant Onyx keys are updated properly when a notification is received, regardless of the online/offline status.\r\nOptimize Onyx Local Storage Usage: Revise local storage handling to ensure that new messages are cached and retrieved effectively when the app is launched from a notification while offline.\r\nImprove AppState Transition Management: In Expensify.js, refine the management of AppState transitions to check and update the UI with new messages when the app resumes from a notification.\r\nSynchronize Messages with Session Data: Guarantee that session data (ONYXKEYS.SESSION) is correctly maintained or restored, especially for syncing messages related to the session.\r\nImplement Offline Feedback: Utilize OfflineIndicator.js and OfflineWithFeedback.js to provide immediate feedback on the message's offline status and display messages correctly in offline mode.\r\nWhat alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBy implementing these changes, we can ensure that the app correctly displays new messages when opened from a notification, even in offline scenarios. This approach aims to enhance the user experience by addressing the core issues related to push notification handling and data synchronization in offline mode.\r\n\r\n",
