Do you have any workaround for this?\r\n\r\nYes instead of saving a single reportID everytime a user opens a report we can save a stack of reportIDs and when opening the `reportIDSetter` will populate the recent opened available reportID to the `ReportScreen` and the case all IDs saved in their don't exist will default to the previous logic of `findLastAccessedReport` \ud83d\udc4d  .",
