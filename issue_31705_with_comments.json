The IOU child report is not being generated optimistically unlike threads for a comment.\r\n2. The composer allows setting the draft even though the `reportID` is `0`.\r\n\r\nUnlike normal comments, `IOU` actions have a `childReportID` that is set by the backend when the action is created (we don't generate it optimistically). This means that if we create a request online and then go offline and click on the request, we are greeted with an infinite loading screen\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/77237602/33c3e6ac-4129-43ce-b6ed-288d5367e6a2\r\n\r\n## What changes should be made to fix this?\r\n\r\n### Options for first issue\r\n**Option 1**\r\nThe backend should not generate the child report for the request as it is not generated on the front-end and the backend should not return the `childReportID` field so that it can be generated optimistically in the front-end when required.\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\nInstead of generating the child report on the backend, we can add the `childReportID` on the front-end itself and build the child report optimistically for every money request in the `IOU.getMoneyRequestInformation()` method itself.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n### Solution for second issue\r\n\r\nWe can pass the `report` to the `ReportFooter` even when the report is not loaded here from the route itself:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/fc14a3f3535e5050421c8f99b5bb5425db81fbb0/src/pages/home/ReportScreen.js#L452\r\n```js\r\n<ReportFooter isReportReadyForDisplay={false} report={{reportID: getReportID(route)}} />\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis prevents the need for adding any additional prop as well.",
