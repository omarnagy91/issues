Because almost all actions can have `reply in thread` option, firstly we can decide which actions don't have `reply in thread` option and create a util function like `shouldReplyInThread` that will return false if the action types are in the list action that doesn't have `Reply in Thread` option, otherwise return `true`.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a new action, if this action can have `Reply in Thread` option, no need to change anything. If not we only need to add this to `shouldReplyInThread`.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)",

As we've built these report actions we've intermittently shown the `reply in thread` button in the comment action menu on them. That created a situation where some report actions allowed threads while others didn't, leading to an inconsistent and confusing experience with no rhyme and reason to it. \r\n\r\n@tgolen outlined some options [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/28934#issuecomment-1797035494) on how we can better catch that in development going forward to make sure we uphold this consistency for threads. That's a good place to start and we'd like someone to explore the options further to put this safeguard in place. \r\n\r\nThanks!\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~014617a7e47bd69ebb</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1726698548887613440</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2023-11-20</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>s77rt | Contributor | 27807672</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>",
