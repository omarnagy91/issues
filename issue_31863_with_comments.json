But we don't prevent the same thing in the policy room\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nWe need to add a condition to check if It is a policy room (announce room), we will only allow the admin of the policy or the assignee to edit the task \r\n```\r\nconst parentReport = ReportUtils.getParentReport(taskReport);\r\n    const policy = allPolicies[`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.POLICY}${parentReport.policyID}`];\r\n    \r\nif (ReportUtils.isAnnounceRoom(parentReport) && lodashGet(policy, 'role', '') !== CONST.POLICY.ROLE.ADMIN) {\r\n        return false\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to do the same behavior in normal room, we will update to use `isChatRoom` function instead of isAnnounceRoom\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?
