Are we sure we don't want to give users the ability to unsubscribe?\r\n\r\nI agree. If the parent message is deleted for a thread, I think the user might still want to subscribe or unsubscribe to the thread. So showing the subscribe/unsubscribe options in the context menu actions for the deleted message is ideal and the existing behaviour appears correct.\r\n\r\nDo you agree? @miljakljajic ",
