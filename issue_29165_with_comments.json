            "body": "@techievivek I'm sorry it took me so long but I had to read all the mentioned comments and threads to get an understanding about the issue we are trying to solve here.\r\n\r\nSo, the issue here is that we have double `withOnyx` used because we are relying in the second one on the value added to props in the first one - is it correct? Then I think the change to the `react-native-onyx` introduced by this PR: https://github.com/Expensify/react-native-onyx/pull/385 could potentially allow us moving the key from the second `withOnyx` to the first one and this way getting rid of the second one, as @pradeepmdk suggested in [their proposal](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/29165#issuecomment-1754840362).\r\n\r\nBut first, I wonder how could I test it - if I understand correctly there should be some new option in `/settings/profile` related to notifications, am I right? I can't see such option so what do I need to do to enable it?",

I can't see such option so what do I need to do to enable it?\r\n\r\nYou can navigate to any DM chat and access the profile of an user from the chat report and that should show you the notification preference option.\r\n",

Moreover, we have now enabled the notification preference option for all the chat reports so maybe we can create a separate component for the notification preference page and reuse that across various pages.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nCreate a separate component for notification preference and get rid of the double onyx call on the profile page. Feel free to come up with your own solutions.\r\n\r\nHere is a potential solution to the problem: https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/28200#discussion_r1338051983\r\n\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013768a6222352d168</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1711676109112000512</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2023-10-24</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>pradeepmdk | Contributor | 27435339</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>",
