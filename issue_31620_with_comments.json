The abbreviations can be easily retrieved by getting public lists/international standard, just like how we construct the timezone list in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf for some reasons the timezone returned is not in our timezone list, then we can fallback to the current approach/or return default `GMT+...` format.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nNA\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

However the solution does not seem to be the best to do here.\r\n\r\n@s77rt I actually think the current way to do it is a workaround. Why would we need the datetime passed as param in order to know the timezone abbreviation? Only the selected timezone should be needed to get the abbreviation since it's a 1:1 map. \r\n\r\nWe're working around it by constructing a date and extract the timezone from it, which is unnecessary and less performant IMO.",

            "body": "@dukenv0307 Indeed the passed datetime is useless since we are only extracting the time zone, any datetime will work just fine. But the current way we are doing it is still the correct way, although it seems that the timezone abbreviation is a 1:1 map it could be complex to maintain. More importantly the list you are suggesting to add is already available in the js engines so it would be a waste to add it again as it will just increase the App bundle size. iOS is the only affected platform where a polyfill is needed but I can see this getting fixed in the future to remove that polyfill and relay only on the Intl API.",
