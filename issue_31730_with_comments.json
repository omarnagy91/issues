It caused hasOutstandingChildRequest is not updated to false. So the green dot still display\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nWe should reset hasOutstandingChildRequest to false when \r\n```\r\nupdatedReportPreviewAction.childMoneyRequestCount === 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\nIN here\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a273354130bbbc057dee4eefb1f9ac0371bec26a/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L2135\r\nwe should add this code\r\n```\r\n...(updatedReportPreviewAction.childMoneyRequestCount === 0\r\n            ? [\r\n                  {\r\n                      onyxMethod: Onyx.METHOD.MERGE,\r\n                      key: `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${chatReport.reportID}`,\r\n                      value: {\r\n                          hasOutstandingIOU: false,\r\n                          hasOutstandingChildRequest: false,\r\n                      },\r\n                  },\r\n              ]\r\n            : []),\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn failure data, we also consider to reset hasOutstandingIOU and hasOutstandingChildRequest to true\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also need to update hasOutstandingIOU and hasOutstandingChildRequest to false in BE side in this case\r\nMore context in API: Deleting request API returns hasOutstandingIOU is true (It is incorrect) although we only use hasOutstandingChildRequest to display green dot. When go to that report, OpenReport API is called and return hasOutstandingChildRequest to true that make the green dot appear again.\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)",
