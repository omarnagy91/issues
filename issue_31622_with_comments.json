            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\nThe amount is not reverted when the update is failed.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\nWhen we update the amount and get an error, we expect it to revert immediately to the previous value, not actually after pressing the error close button.\r\n\r\nIn the IOU edit code, we already have a `failureData` to revert the failed update to the previous amount (or any field) here\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/0cca90ab9aa7fd9467ef45ca35c4d0ad3c3334ae/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L1933-L1947\r\n\r\nHowever, I can see that we always get an error, that is, we can't use Onyx.set after Onyx.merge.\r\n<img width=\"489\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/50919443/99acfe42-f48c-434c-9c3c-709c16b4de40\">\r\n\r\nThis issue happens after https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/27609 where we change the (3) onyx method from `merge` to `set`. \r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/0cca90ab9aa7fd9467ef45ca35c4d0ad3c3334ae/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L1944-L1957\r\n\r\nThe reason behind it is [this](https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/27609/files#r1349651509). In short, when we update a transaction, either its amount, description, or other fields, we add a new field/property to the transaction object called `modifiedAmount`, `modifiedCreated`, etc. and if we merge the old transaction object, these new properties won't be removed from the object, so the new test added will fail.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nThere are 3 onyx keys that the method is changed to `set` (`transaction`, `iou report`, and `chat report`). Change all 3 back to `merge`. \r\n\r\nThen, we will handle the revert when fails correctly by merging the new property with null. \r\n\r\nLet's start with `transaction`. To know which property is new when we update the transaction, compare the new property from [getUpdatedTransaction](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/libs/TransactionUtils.ts#L117) and [buildOptimisticTransaction](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/libs/TransactionUtils.ts#L33).\r\n\r\nThose new properties are:\r\n1. `modifiedCreated`\r\n2. `modifiedAmount`\r\n3. `modifiedCurrency`\r\n4. `modifiedMerchant`\r\n5. `modifiedWaypoints`\r\n6. `pendingFields`\r\n\r\nAnd in the failure data, we will do it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonyxMethod: Onyx.METHOD.MERGE,\r\nkey: `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.TRANSACTION}${transactionID}`,\r\nvalue: {\r\n    ...transaction,\r\n    modifiedCreated: transaction.modifiedCreated ?? null,\r\n    modifiedAmount: transaction.modifiedAmount ?? null,\r\n    modifiedCurrency: transaction.modifiedCurrency ?? null,\r\n    modifiedMerchant: transaction.modifiedMerchant ?? null,\r\n    modifiedWaypoints: transaction.modifiedWaypoints ?? null,\r\n    pendingFields: null,\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, `iou report` and `chat report`.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/0cca90ab9aa7fd9467ef45ca35c4d0ad3c3334ae/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L1789-L1822\r\n\r\nIf you see the above code, you can notice that for `chat report`, we only update `lastMessageText` and `lastMessageHtml` property and both are existing property that is available optimistically, so nothing to change for `chat report`. For the `iou report` though, we update \r\n1. `total`\r\n2. `cachedTotal`\r\n3. `ownerAccountID` (in `IOUUtils.updateIOUOwnerAndTotal`)\r\n4. `managerID` (in `IOUUtils.updateIOUOwnerAndTotal`)\r\n5. `hasOutstandingIOU` (in `IOUUtils.updateIOUOwnerAndTotal`)\r\n6. `lastMessageText`\r\n7. `lastMessageHtml`\r\n\r\nBoth `lastMessageText` and `lastMessageHtml` is not created optimistically which I think a bit inconsistent with how we create a normal `chat report`. So, the solution for `iou report` is to create `lastMessageText` and `lastMessageHtml` value optimistically.\r\n\r\n(taken from `ReportUtils.buildOptimisticChatReport`)\r\n```\r\nlastMessageHtml: '',\r\nlastMessageText: null,\r\n```\r\n\r\n_The solution is pretty long, but I think it's what we should do earlier_",
