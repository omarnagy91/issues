Messages _appear_ to send when you go back online after reload, but if you go back offline you'll see they're restyled again as offline, and were never actually sent. If the page is reloaded before the user goes back online, any offline actions will not be sent.\r\n\r\n`persistedRequests` is being mutated from outside of the `save()` method in `PersistedRequests`, resulting in `Onyx.set()` detecting no change in the value, and bailing before actually updating the store. The store remains empty after each `save()`.\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/405269a838d034ced6ccdd5e9c4be0af92cfe9b7/src/libs/actions/PersistedRequests.ts#L21-L32\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nMake a local copy of `persistedRequests` within the `save()` function to ensure outside mutations don't have impact. This is how we avoided mutations prior to the regression, and we should be doing this kind of thing in general when dealing with non-primitive mutable values. Ideally we'd go immutable for this, but that's a bigger scope.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction save(requestToPersist: Request) {\r\n    const requests = persistedRequests.slice();\r\n    // Check for a request w/ matching idempotencyKey in the queue\r\n    const existingRequestIndex = requests.findIndex((request) => request.data?.idempotencyKey && request.data?.idempotencyKey === requestToPersist.data?.idempotencyKey);\r\n    if (existingRequestIndex > -1) {\r\n        // Merge the new request into the existing one, keeping its place in the queue\r\n        requests.splice(existingRequestIndex, 1, requestToPersist);\r\n    } else {\r\n        // If not, push the new request to the end of the queue\r\n        requests.push(requestToPersist);\r\n    }\r\n    persistedRequests = requests;\r\n    Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.PERSISTED_REQUESTS, requests);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What alternative solutions did you explore?\r\nMake `persistedRequests` immutable. This is an option and would be ideal, just takes more work and adds more risk. Recommend my primary solution for a sure fix, as this is an impactful issue.",
