The current code attempts to infer a missing name from the URL, but this process is flawed and fails to execute correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the case of **BUG2**, it stems from the same issue as BUG1. The incorrect handling of missing file names leads to improperly generated names, particularly with datetime elements that include illegal characters (like `:`).\r\n\r\nFor **BUG3**, the issue arises because `fileName` is marked as a required property, but there are instances, particularly with some Concierge attachments, where it is not provided. This discrepancy leads to the console error we are witnessing.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nTo resolve **BUG1**, we should refine the code that deals with downloading attachments. This includes enhancing the logic to handle cases where the `fileName` attribute is missing, ensuring it can accurately infer the name from the attachment's URL.\r\n\r\nTo fix **BUG2**, the solution involves revising the logic that generates file names, especially focusing on how datetime elements are processed. This revision should ensure that the names comply with standard naming conventions and do not include illegal characters.\r\n\r\nFor **BUG3**, we have two potential approaches. We can either update the `propType` for `fileName` to make it non-required and provide a default value, or we can implement a fallback mechanism where the `fileName` is inferred from the URL if it is not explicitly provided.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be to conduct a thorough audit of all attachment use cases (including server/backend code) to ensure `fileName` is consistently provided. This approach, while potentially more robust, could be resource-intensive and might not be feasible.\r\n",
