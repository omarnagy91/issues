            "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.\r\n\r\nReports with only comments autofocus the composer on mobile web and native.\r\n\r\n### What is the root cause of that problem?\r\n\r\nSame root cause as #31243.\r\n\r\nWhen the app is opened, a subset of report actions for all reports are loaded, and comments are excluded, presumably to avoid preloading the entire chat history of every report. A report with only comments will initially have no report actions loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is a race condition. When the report first loads, _sometimes_, it will appear to be an empty chat because there are no report actions, and `isEmptyChat` will evalute true: https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/0cca90ab9aa7fd9467ef45ca35c4d0ad3c3334ae/src/pages/home/report/ReportActionCompose/ComposerWithSuggestions/ComposerWithSuggestions.js#L128\r\n\r\nWe intentionally autofocus the composer, even on mobile, if the chat is empty.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nA workaround on the frontend to fix this would require confirming that report actions have been fetched - effectively that `OpenReport` has completed, which is a bit of a hack.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution is the one that I also proposed for #31243 - in addition to the report actions currently returned from `OpenApp` by the backend, the latest report action for each report should always be returned, no matter the type, including comments.",
