            "body": "(FROM UPWORK)\r\nEdit: I apologize for not reading the contributor guidlines in full prior to the proposal. Previous  proposal retained for posterity.\r\n\r\nRestatement of the Problem\r\nThe issue at hand is maintaining accessibility to a receipt file in a React Native application across page reloads. When a user attaches a receipt to a manual IOU request, it's stored as a local file blob. While the application can access this file during the current session, a page reload renders the file inaccessible, even though its reference is still present in the application's state.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause of the Problem\r\nThe core of the problem lies in the session-specific nature of blob URLs created using URL.createObjectURL(). These URLs are only valid within the current browser or app session. When the page or app is reloaded, these blob URLs become invalid, and the corresponding file blobs are no longer accessible, leading to the loss of the file data.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution\r\nTo address this issue, the solution involves two key changes:\r\n\r\nConversion to Data URL: When a user attaches a receipt, instead of storing a blob URL, convert the file blob into a data URL. This conversion encodes the file as a Base64 string, which can be stored in the application's state.\r\n\r\nStoring and Restoring Data URL: Store this data URL in the IOU state. When the file needs to be accessed (e.g., on MoneyRequestConfirmPage), convert the data URL back into a file blob. This reconversion allows the application to use the file as if it were newly uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious Proposal:\r\nProposal\r\nTechnical Explanation:\r\nThe blob is being orphaned making the state representation no longer valid.\r\nProposed solution:\r\nConvert the blob to a URI/URL\r\n\r\n```\r\nconvertBlobToDataURL(fileBlob, (dataURL) => {\r\n    // Store dataURL in the state\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// After page reload, recreate the blob if needed\r\nconst blob = dataURLToBlob(storedDataURL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should have a streamlined user experience, where the selected file is applied after reload. This may fix the issue in other places of the codebase as well.",
