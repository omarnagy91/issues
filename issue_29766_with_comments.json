This works for the new requests, but if we are replacing the receipt, the route params look like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"EditRequest_Root-xiCzvsFIN5uLz1knTTGpu\",\r\n    \"name\": \"EditRequest_Root\",\r\n    \"params\": {\r\n        \"threadReportID\": \"5081786922064036\",\r\n        \"field\": \"receipt\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the report ID here is `threadReportID`, not `reportID`.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\nWe should fetch the report by either reportID or, if absent, - try the threadReportID:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default withOnyx({\r\n    iou: {key: ONYXKEYS.IOU},\r\n    report: {\r\n        key: ({route}) => {\r\n            const reportID = lodashGet(route, 'params.reportID') || lodashGet(route, 'params.threadReportID', '');\r\n            return `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${reportID}`;\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n})(ReceiptSelector);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to handle both cases: new IOU report creation and receipt replacement.\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?

            "body": "Okay, but that wasn't really my question. \ud83d\ude05 The issue linked to has a similar root cause in that you are able to replace a receipt while it's still scanning. After which, you can run into these downstream \"bugs\" as side effects; 1) you can't delete the receipt 2) other participants can't see the replaced receipt\r\n\r\nSo just like we hide the ability to detach a receipt while it's still scanning, we should hide the ability to replace a receipt while it's still scanning. That avoids both of these issues. So my question is if that's going to be implemented in #28021? If so, can this issue go on hold until a PR is merged for that as we don't need to do anything in addition whether that be on the BE or FE. ",
