We are incrementing the raw value in the default currency to the `iouReport.total` here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/a72223541479aca934df3f05a46fb1aae0dacc54/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L467-L468 \r\nand then that `iouReport.total` value is getting displayed in the report preview with the workspace currency until the real data (value converted to the workspace currency)  comes from BE.\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nIf it is possible to convert currencies in FE we should set the optimistic amount after converting it to the workspace currency \r\nOr else we should stop displaying optimistic data and wait for the BE in the cases where there is a mismatch between workspace currency and default currency to avoid displaying the wrong amount. \ud83d\udc4d \r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore?

The backend, because the backend creates the `iouReport`and dictates its currency. As for now, this is why we can't change the `iouReport`'s currency after creation [link to fix](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/27060#issuecomment-1813133832). Also, it's the only place where we can compute the `iouReport`'s total amount in terms of default workspace currency. Due to this reason, the frontend temporarily sets the requested amount in the `ReportPreview` component using the default workspace currency, even if both currencies are different.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/85f372c4e35c30119e72c7689959282a298bad1b/src/components/ReportActionItem/ReportPreview.js#L153\r\n\r\nThis is the line where `props.iouReportID.currency`, which is set by the policy, is used to produce a string with the workspace's right currency but the wrong amount value, `totalDisplaySpend` from the function `ReportUtils.getMoneyRequestSpendBreakdown`.\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nSince we do not have the correct amount from the server, every possible figure we can show will eventually change. Unless the currencies are the same, therefore, the most appropriate solution in this situation is to display `TBD`. Then, the correct IOU amount will be displayed once the server pushes it. The reason why I believe this is the most appropriate solution is because, not only will it improve the user's offline experience, we already have implemented this method with distance requests. When a user's distance request changes waypoints and before the server returns the distance request's `amount`, if not manually set, and `distance`, the `ReportPreview` component will display `TBD`. To gain a further understanding of why `TBD` is used for distance requests, here is a recent [merged pull request](https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/30232) and [closed issue](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/29899) that might help.\r\n\r\nHence, we create a very strict condition that is only `true` in this specific case, so we don't create regressions. The condition below is capable of determining whether the amount to be displayed on the `ReportPreview` is incorrect and is going to be updated soon.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst isWaitingOnAmount = isPolicyExpenseChat && lodashGet(props.iouReport, 'pendingFields.createChat') === CONST.RED_BRICK_ROAD_PENDING_ACTION.ADD && props.iouReport !== TransactionUtils.getAllReportTransactions(props.iouReportID)[0].currency\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/85f372c4e35c30119e72c7689959282a298bad1b/src/components/ReportActionItem/ReportPreview.js#L150-L152\r\n\r\nUsing `isWaitingOnAmount` to change the condition above to look something similar to the one below should show `TBD` for incorrect amount values.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (hasPendingWaypoints || isWaitingOnAmount) {\r\n    return props.translate('common.tbd');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult Video:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/22982173/2bb9ce0b-8151-4381-8867-8abb3f579485\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\nThis solution is like the previous one, but we use the amount in the very first money request currency, `TransactionUtils.getAllReportTransactions(props.iouReportID)[0]` instead of the default WS currency.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/85f372c4e35c30119e72c7689959282a298bad1b/src/components/ReportActionItem/ReportPreview.js#L153\r\n\r\nWe will use the same condition as before and change the line above to look something similar to the one below.
